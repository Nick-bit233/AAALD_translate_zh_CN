# A Brief History of Architecture and Level Design

> Chapter 1
>
> When many designers consider looking at level design through the lens
> of architecture, they think of utilizing historic precedents
>
> to enhance their environment art or create an epic backdrop for their
> game. As we will see in later chapters, these uses are not far off the
> mark in terms of level design. Using architectural language that the
> player rec- ognizes but may associate with exotic places is one way to
> enhance the experience of your game. These experiences enhance a
> game's ability to bring players into its make-believe world and
> provide the feeling that the player's actions have some sort of effect
> on important events.
>
> Looking to historic precedents can have other important effects for
> designers, however. Beyond being inspirations for backdrops,
> historical spaces have many lessons to teach about how space is
> composed. While form has always been a consideration of architects,
> historic buildings were also built with a great focus on the
> experience they created for visitors. As such, level designers looking
> to architecture for insight into their own work can learn a great deal
> about composing sight lines, telling stories with levels, and many
> other spatial design principles by carefully studying historic
> structures.

## BREAKING THE RULES OF LEVEL DESIGN

> A common struggle in game development is whether software/technology
> or theory is more important for understanding how games are made.
> Software advocates argue that game developers should focus on the
> technol- ogy of games to make advances. They focus on software-based
> techniques to demonstrate the "correct" ways of making games or game
> assets. This is done both to utilize new technology and to directly
> address the limitations of the platform upon which a given game is
> developed. To these designers, theory is impractical: good games are
> only created through the experience of creating lots of games. Theory
> advocates, on the other hand, see software as a means to an end, a
> tool for creating game experiences, rather than an end unto itself. To
> these designers, theory is a way to build upon the knowledge generated
> by the creation of previous games. This allows them to decode the more
> mysterious elements of game experiences through theoretical guidelines
> rather than pin down the correct rules for design. In truth, we should
> be looking at a mix of the two: usable design theory utilized in
> concert with practical concerns of game development. This way, we can
> push the tenets of game design while addressing practical concerns.
> Among the many facets of game design, level design is one of the most
> difficult to isolate as having one correct methodology. It is for this
> rea- son that we need to approach both methodology-based discussions
> of level design and theoretical ones. As we will see in Chapter 2,
> "Tools and Techniques for Level Design," the way a designer approaches
> level con- struction can vary depending on the tools he or she is
> using to develop the game, and, if he or she is using a middleware
> engine, which engine he or she is using. Designing for games of
> different genres or play mechanics can
>
> further complicate matters: a level for a first-person shooter has
> different needs than a level for a puzzle platformer, etc.
>
> In many ways, level design cannot be learned in the same way some-
> thing like 3D game art can. With few exceptions, there is an accepted
> way of creating 3D art, just as there are accepted ways of creating
> game sound or specific classes one would use to utilize inputs when
> scripting in a game engine. In this way, level design differs from
> many other topics in game development. Software-based tutorials for
> level design typically utilize engines geared toward specific game
> types (often first-person shooters). While these demonstrate
> software-specific methods that get developers started, they often do
> little to give designers advice on how they might best create spatial
> experiences. For this type of information, it's best to focus less on
> software or game-specific learning and more on spatial theory.
>
> At one time, an emphasis on software to the detriment of theory was an
> issue plaguing game design. Prior to 2003, books on the general design
> of games and game design theory were rare, and many books on "game
> design" were actually software or coding manuals. One of the earliest
> examples of a book devoted to game design theory is *The Art of
> Computer Game Design*1 by Chris Crawford. Written in 1984, it was one
> of the few game design theory books for many years. In the 2000s,
> publications such as *Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game
> Design*,2 *Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals*,3 *The Art of Game
> Design*,4 and *Game Design Workshop*5 advanced the field from purely
> computational to an aesthetic practice. These books take a much more
> generalist approach to game design, show- ing readers how to conceive
> of games through their mechanical, narrative, or experiential
> elements. Ian Schreiber and Brenda Brathwaite's *Challenges for Game
> Designers*6 has readers actively deconstruct games to learn new things
> about them. In this way, games become modular systems that can be
> shaped by designers rather than the result of specific how-to manuals.
> Many of these books draw from fields outside of game design to influ-
> ence their material. Salen and Zimmerman discuss not only the design
> of famous games, but also the work of multiple psychologists,
> designers, architects, and others to synthesize how one might create
> games.
>
> We need to similarly break the rules of how we understand level design
> if we are to advance it. While it can be beneficial to explore the
> design of levels for games of specific genres, there is also a lot of
> room for generaliza- tion. For example, if we were to say, "In
> first-person shooters, it is tactically advantageous to have a high
> position to shoot from," this could be a good criterion for designing
> deathmatch maps: having lots of sniping positions

> and crisscrossing catwalks. If we remove the specificity to
> first-person shooters, however, we can say, "It is advantageous to
> have a high position when in a game level." This can then be applied
> to stealth games, fighting games, platformers, first-person shooters,
> and many others (Figure 1.1). Understanding this, a developer working
> in a specific engine can apply this spatial knowledge in whatever way
> works best for it: creating a tall BSP Brush geometry in Unreal,
> importing a tall level object into Unity, building a tall structure
> with tiles in Game Maker, etc. This is how we approach level design in
> this book: as information that designers can uti- lize in the context
> of their software of choice.
>
> In this way, architectural history has a lot to show us about how
> gamespace can be constructed. If we understand level design as the
> appli- cation of a broad set of general spatial theories applied to
> playable games, we can use experientially rich architecture---that
> meant to elicit an emo- tional response from occupants or affect their
> behavior in some way---as a precedent for our own level designs.

## AN EXPERIENTIAL HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE

> There are many ways to understand the history of architecture. Some
> writers focus on a history of structural components: post-and-lintel
> construction, column types, arches, domes, vaults, etc. (Figure 1.2).
> Others focus on the evolutions of styles over time. Some of these
> styles have philosophies that impact how one explores works in that
> style, but often they focus on the formal or sculptural aspects of
> buildings. Lastly, there is the evolution of architectural
> experiences. These can be closely related to cultural factors of the
> times and places in which they were built.

> FIGURE 1.2 Standard structural elements found in architecture. These
> can be useful to game designers and environment artists seeking to
> have believable architectural components in their game levels.
>
> They often most closely reflect the ideas of the designers and
> builders of space. Experientially-focused buildings utilize space to
> create specific experiences or evoke some idea broader than the
> architecture itself.
>
> Understanding these varied outlooks on architectural history can be
> useful to game and level designers. Having proper structural elements
> in a level adds to the *structural believability* of a gamespace. If a
> column does not look like it would reasonably support a building in
> real life, for example, players may notice a similar inconsistency if
> this same column is used in environmental art---breaking player
> engagement. Knowledge of architectural style and form helps art
> directors create the look of games. Some games utilize fictional
> architectures inspired by real styles. The *Halo* series, for example,
> often utilizes Gothic-inspired motifs for game lev- els,7 the latest
> example being *Halo 4*'s8 Requiem mission (Figure 1.3). Architectural
> allusions can be a good way to theme your gamespace or give it a sense
> of epic otherworldliness. In the case of *Halo*, the vertical elements
> of Forerunner buildings lend to the Forerunner race's perceived power
> and mythical presence in the series. Style and form will be an
> important part of the discussions in this book, as they discuss the
> lan- guage through which we communicate with players.

> engaging experiences for players. This is why we focus not on the
> entirety of architectural history---that is a topic for an entire
> book, several of which already exist---but instead on a selection of
> architectural pieces that have some important experience to talk
> about. Some of these pieces will also have structural or formal
> elements wor- thy of note, which is discussed later in the book.

> meaningful and emotionally evocative user experience.

> Elements of Architecture and Level Design
>
> The Roman architect Vitruvius, who lived around 40 bce, considered
> *firmitas* (firmness), *utilitias* (utility), and *venustas* (delight)
> to be the vital elements of architecture.9 This book, based on spatial
> design theory while addressing practical elements of level
> construction, utilizes elements simi- lar to those outlined by
> Vitruvius.
>
> *Functional Requirements*
>
> First and foremost, your game must work. This is the *firmitas* of
> level design. It is for this reason that this book will keep theory
> discussions grounded in level construction methods. Chapter 2, for
> example, dis- cusses practical elements of level design, including
> overviews of level construction methods for several engines. Later
> chapters discuss theory
>
> with an eye toward how game assets may be used to fulfill experiential
> goals for level design.
>
> *Usability*
>
> Next, gamespaces must be usable. In this way, we should concentrate on
> how players see gamespace through points of view and game cameras and
> how one navigates levels. This element of level design concentrates on
> navigation and teaching. As we will see, levels are an opportunity for
> game designers to have an indirect conversation with players. As such,
> our game levels should teach players how to use themselves and speak
> in easily understood language.
>
> *Delight*
>
> Lastly, our gamespaces should be rewarding to go through. For this, we
> must engage the psychological elements of level design and understand
> how levels guide players through emotional experiences. By challenging
> and rewarding players, we offer them opportunities to have agency over
> the climactic elements of games in ways no other media form can offer.
> For this, we should strive to create the most engaging experience
> possible. It is important to note that these experiences are not
> mutually exclu- sive, nor is any one hierarchically more important
> than another; they are equally important for level design (Figure
> 1.4). It is also important

> The Beginnings of Architectural Sight Lines
>
> In its earliest form, architecture was simply a means of shelter⎯the
> ultimate in fulfilling functional requirement. Fitting early man's
> migra- tory lifestyle, early dwellings were in caves or were
> constructed from temporary, portable materials such as animal skins
> and poles. As humans became increasingly agricultural, they settled in
> a single place and their shelters became more hut-like. This occurred
> about 12,000 years ago, during the Holocene period.10 Over time,
> settlements became large cities, one of the earliest being the
> biblical Jericho, originally settled 8000 bce in what is now
> Palestine.
>
> With the rise of urban living came the rise of non-hunter/gatherer
> roles for occupants. Among these were priests and other hierarchically
> important persons who oversaw the settlement's links to deities and
> the afterlife. Concentration on the spiritual elements of one's life
> also necessitated the construction of buildings for spiritual
> purposes, espe- cially worship and burial. The architecture of these
> buildings reacted to sacred elements in the lives of their builders.
> Western European sites such as the Newgrange passage grave in County
> Meath, Ireland, and Stonehenge in Salisbury, England, are examples of
> this type of architec- ture. A transom-like opening in the Newgrange
> grave allows the light of sunrise during the winter solstice to enter
> and illuminate the grave's inner chamber (Figure 1.5). Stonehenge is
> oriented such that the sunrise during the summer solstice occurs
> directly over a heel stone at its eastern end. This has led some to
> conclude that the site was a giant observatory

> Architecture as Representation in Ancient Mesopotamia
>
> The invention of written language by the Sumerians in 3500 bce is
> largely considered the border between prehistoric and historic periods
> in human history. The Sumerians were one of several civilizations that
> began in Mesopotamia, a territory in modern-day Iraq, Iran, Syria, and
> Turkey con- sidered the cradle of Western civilization. Mesopotamia
> was home to several peoples, including the Sumerians, Akkadians,
> Assyrians, and Babylonians. The Sumerians worshipped many deities, and
> thus greatly influenced the development of temple forms. During the
> Neo-Sumerian period (ca. 2150--2000 bce), they developed the
> *ziggurat*, a temple raised on an artificial mound, often built of
> kiln-fired brick. The development of the ziggurat is important in the
> development of architecture as a system of representation. The

> mountains from which the Sumerians migrated. In this way, the
> Sumerians were using shapes or ornamentation of buildings to convey a
> larger idea.
>
> Later Mesopotamian civilizations, such as the Babylonians and
> Assyrians, would also use architecture as representational forms. The
> constantly warring Assyrians especially utilized their architecture as
> a means to convey their power and ferocity. They made great use of the
> ziggurat form to elevate their palaces above surrounding villages. In
> Sargon II's royal city of Korsabad, built in 720 bce, realistic
> sculptures of animals---bulls, eagles, etc.---and of conquering armies
> warned visitors of the dangers of defying Assyrian power. The spatial
> layout of the palace utilized circuitous sequences of rooms for
> reaching important chambers such as the throne room. This was to
> confuse and further accentuate the absolute power of the Assyrians
> (Figure 1.8). The representational systems utilized by Mesopotamian
> cultures will be useful as we study how to build game worlds and use
> art and sound assets to set environmental tone.

> Architecture as Statement in Ancient Egypt
>
> Ancient Egyptian civilization began ca. 3000 bce with the uniting of
> Upper and Lower Egypt by Pharaoh King Menes. Egyptian monumental
> architecture focused heavily on establishing links between the
> pharaohs and the gods. It was believed that during life, the pharaohs
> were manifestations of the falcon-headed god Horus. Upon death, they
> were linked with Osiris, lord of the underworld. Both gods were linked
> with Ra, the sun god. It was for this reason that many Egyptian
> architectural works utilize the *pyramid* form, either as an entire
> building or as the tops of obelisks (Figure 1.9), as it was believed
> to establish links between the pharaohs and the sun god.

> Imhotep, court architect to the pharaoh Djoser, designed one of the
> first pyramids in 2630 bce. The building was begun as another tradi-
> tional Egyptian form, a *mastaba*---short stone tomb---but was
> elaborated on by stacking several mastabas on top of one another.

> The physical positioning of chambers has symbolic significance, such
> as those bored into the bedrock below the pyramids, representing the
> under- world. Similarly, special materials such as red granite are
> used to empha- size important spaces such as the king's chamber in
> Khufu's pyramid. The constructions of early Egyptian monuments and
> tombs, from form to materials, were carefully planned to communicate
> the importance of their patrons.
>
> Later Egyptian works would move away from the pyramid form and toward
> temple forms with sequential spaces. The mortuary temple of Queen
> Hatshepsut, built between 1473 and 1458 bce, utilized a sequence of
> terraces and colonnades to emphasize depictions of the queen's life
> embedded in the walls of the temple. These temples also utilized
> *hypostyle* halls, spaces with a dense grid of columns holding up a
> stone roof. Experientially, these halls created the feeling of a vast
> expanse with dim lighting to make the room feel ethereal (Figure
> 1.10). Evidence suggests that the Egyptians' use of such columns,
> especially those with faceted sides, would later influence Greek
> column styles.
>
> The architectural styles of the Egyptians can likewise influence our
> own understanding of space. On one hand, they standardized forms such
> as the pyramid and the column to create the beginnings of modular
> archi- tectural language. On the other, they associated ideas with
> these modular pieces such that they were universally recognizable
> within the culture.

> Spatial and Symbolic Relationships in Greek Architecture
>
> In the West, Classical Greek civilization is credited with many
> advance- ments in art, architecture, philosophy, politics, science,
> and other fields.
>
> It is no wonder then that Greek architecture can be utilized to
> understand how relationships between objects and environments drive
> our experience of space. The Greek philosopher Plato, for example,
> sought inner beauty through the expression of *form*, the perfect
> embodiment of proportional geometries that humans attempt to recreate
> through art and architecture.11 Greek architecture emphasized ratios
> and dimension to establish forms. The relationships between buildings
> often occurred on care- fully planned axes or sight lines. During
> Greece's Archaic period, ca. 800--480 bce, temple architecture was
> established following the form of *megarons*, rectangular spaces with
> entrances on the shorter sides so the space was perceived as very
> long. In Greek temple architecture (Figure 1.11), this established a
> processional sequence of spaces from the temple's entry- way
> (*pronaos*) to a long interior space (*cella* or *naos*) where the
> statue of the deity would reside, and an additional rear room
> (*opisthodomos*). This period also saw the establishment of what the
> Roman architect Vitruvius would later call the *orders* of
> architectural columns: *Doric*, *Ionic*, and *Corinthian*. These three
> orders represented the proportions of men (Doric), women (Ionic), and
> young maidens (Corinthian) in their form and ornamentations (Figure
> 1.12). The use of these columns allows the creation of subtle
> proportional effects in temple design. Doric columns, for example,
> lend a weighty and assertive nature to buildings, while Ionic

> columned buildings "feel" light, as though they were being lifted from
> the ground. More important than their formal qualities is the fact
> that these columns are among several elements that founded the Greek
> *architectural vocabulary*. Architectural vocabularies, often referred
> to as *vernacular*, are consistent elements utilized throughout the
> structures of a specific culture or aesthetic. Architectural
> vocabularies throughout history allow specific formal arrangements to

>
> Later Greek public architecture during the Classical period (between
> 479 and 323 bce) brings concepts of spatial hierarchies and
> arrangements even more to the forefront. The Athenian Acropolis, built
> in 479 bce, utilizes a carefully planned spatial sequence to guide
> visitors around and into its primary buildings, the Temple of Athena
> Nike, the Propylaea, the Erechtheion, and the Parthenon (Figure 1.13).
> The approach to the Parthenon seems random, but was a carefully
> planned sequence of per- spectival experiences. First, visitors would
> see the Acropolis from far away as they approached the hill on which
> it sat. Next, they would enter the entrance portico of the Acropolis,
> the Propylaea. This building offered a choice: continue onward to the
> Acropolis proper or divert slightly to the Temple of Athena Nike.
> Those who continued to the Acropolis proper would view it from behind
> a screen of columns, framing the statue of Athena. The Parthenon
> itself was viewed at a slight angle. This was intentional, as
> designers intended for it to be viewed three-dimensionally by walk-
> ing around it and seeing it in perspective rather than seeing it

> Medieval Christian and Islamic Symbolic Architecture
>
> During the Roman Empire, a new religion rose in prominence around

> and his making it the state religion. From 610 to 633 ce, Islam took
> root in the Arab world following what is said to have been an
> appearance by the angel Gabriel to the prophet Mohammed in Mecca.
> These religions, their devel- opment, and their interactions with one
> another would have great impact on Medieval architectures.

> of minarets, tall towers from which the faithful could be called to
> prayer. Like Christian architecture, Islamic architecture utilized

> The Renaissance Return to Human-Centered Architecture

> In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, an increased
> interest in classical influences, beginning in Italy, brought about a
> cultural, artistic, and scientific Renaissance. While Renaissance

> period---arches, domes, and classi- cal column orders, with elements

> More important for our exploration, however, is the Renaissance's
> emphasis on mathematical ratios inspired by the works of Plato. These
> studies led to an increase in *humanist* architectural forms, which
> stemmed from the belief that the human body was derived from divine
> ratios (Figure 1.22). Many Florentine palaces utilized different
> propor- tions for demarcating public and private spaces. Beginning

> Another facet of Baroque architecture useful to level designers is
> Baroque city planning. The first major work of this kind was the
> replan- ning of Rome by Pope Sixtus V in the late 1580s and
> implemented over the next century. Axial streets linked many of the
> major pilgrimage churches in the city (Figure 1.25). This was to aid

> plazas, such as the Piazza del Popolo, were constructed to accommodate
> visitors. This type of planning would be evident in other projects
> such as the gardens of Versailles, which later influenced the axial
> street and node-based plan of Washington, D.C.

> rationalism of industrial architecture, the arts and crafts movement

## THE HISTORY OF GAMESPACES

> Like much of architectural history, the history of gamespaces has been
> influenced by the purpose of the space (i.e., the game being played)
> and the limitations of materials for constructing these spaces. In
> many ways, games are as old as the architectures that we have just
> explored, with early examples of both occurring in the same locations
> around the same time periods. Even then, it was important that
> gamespaces corresponded to the rules of play.
>
> Early games such as the Royal Game of Ur and Senet, both created
> between 3500 and 2500 bce, were race games whose boards reflected the
> pattern that players had to traverse to win the game. Later board
> games such as backgammon, a descendent of these race games, as well as
> chess, Go, checkers, and numerous others, utilized boards that
> embodied their rules spatially. Chess and Go are about territorial
> control and the captur- ing of opponents' pieces based on the movement
> rules of one's own pieces. Chess features a specific ruleset on what
> each piece may do, while Go fea- tures a few simple rules that apply
> to all pieces equally---vastly increas- ing the possible board
> combinations that can occur. As such, the spaces embody not only the
> rules of play, but also the potential for unique player reactions to
> these rules.
>
> Physical Gamespaces and Architecture
>
> Physical gamespaces such as playing fields and arenas responded to the
> intended gameplay. Ancient analogs to modern sports such as football
> (soccer), basketball, lacrosse, and others utilize spatial elements in
> their design: goals, defensive lines, etc. When these games were
> eventually codified into their modern forms, they gained even more
> direct spatial elements: boundaries, zones for which there are rules
> of how or whether the ball can be possessed, and others (Figure 1.28).
> Once they were organized, these games often also gained spectator
> areas, which added out-of-game elements to the overall experience,
> making these games simultaneously game and performance.
>
> In *Man, Play, Games*, anthropologist Richard Caillois12a identifies
> fundamental categories of play, one of which is *mimicry*, which
> includes theater and other staged productions.13 Like spectator
> sports, these events are performed in spaces whose performance area
> (the field for a game or the stage for a play) caters to the
> performance needs of the event. Boundaries and field markers in sports
> embody the rules of play. Likewise, the stage for a theater production
> anticipates the choreography of the pro- duction: How will the
> lighting be arranged to best show the performance? Is there an
> orchestra pit or choir area? Is there room for dancing if the
> production calls for it? How do scenery and lighting describe the
> setting?

> FIGURE 1.28 Fields for various sports: football (soccer), basketball,
> baseball, and American football. Each of these fields has spatial
> elements for which there are rules governing how players may utilize
> them. Scoring is often related to guiding a ball to or hitting it such
> that the player can reach scoring territories.
>
> Dating back to the Hellenistic Greek period, theaters have been an
> important civic structure. Ancient Greek amphitheaters utilized many
> of the elements common in theater design today, a circular area for
> the orchestra, a *skene* building that acted as the backdrop and
> backstage, and the *proskenion*, from which the performance occurred.
> These theaters were reactions to the needs of the theater productions
> and allowed for the development of performance innovations not
> originally intended. This included utilization of the skene as a place
> from which an actor could deliver lines as an unseen supernatural
> character or change costumes between scenes.
>
> This modularity of uses was also reflected in stadiums such as the
> Flavian Amphitheater, popularly known as the Roman Coliseum. Famous as
> a venue for gladiatorial combat, it was also the site for ani- mal
> hunts and scenic recreations that utilized real tree and animal
> life.14 Tunnels for the preparation of gladiators and the
> transportation of sce- nic elements were located under the spectator
> areas, and even in some cases under the floor of the stadium itself.
> The tunnels beneath the per- formance space featured elevators and
> trap doors for the introduction of animals into events. Like Greek
> theaters, the Flavian Amphitheater was a space for basic contests, but
> also allowed for elaboration based on the imaginations of organizers.
> Several possibilities are imagined in the 2000 film *Gladiator*:
> gladiator fights, chariot battles, historic rec- reations, fights with
> dangerous animals in a ring around combatants, and others.15
>
> Digital Gamespaces
>
> In the twentieth century, the invention of electronic computers and
> sub- sequent development of games for them began the concept of
> designing digital spaces for games. One of the first visually
> displayed electronic games, *Noughts and Crosses*, borrows the board
> design from the popu- lar game tic-tac-toe, which embodies the rules
> of play: line up three of your own shapes while preventing your
> opponent from doing the same. Another early electronic game, *Tennis
> for Two*,16 similarly borrowed its simulated gamespace from the sport
> tennis. It displayed the game from the side rather than the top down,
> necessitating a simplification of ten- nis's rules to focus on getting
> the ball over the net, but not on specific rules based on court lines
> (Figure 1.29). Later tennis-like games such as Ralph Baer's *Tennis*17
> or Atari's *Pong*18 would depict the game abstractly from the top
> down, excluding shooting over the net as a challenge and

## WAYS OF SEEING FOR LEVEL DESIGN

> To fully understand spatial design principles for level design,
> precedents from both real-world architecture and video games must be
> analyzed. The next chapter discusses drawing techniques for
> documenting anal- yses, but first we must understand how to best view
> designed space. Hal Box, FAIA, professor emeritus and former dean of
> the School of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin,
> argues for an educated form of *seeing* architecture based on study
> and analysis. In this case,
>
> seeing is used not only to describe using the visual senses, but also
> to process the spatial, formal, contextual, and historical elements
> that make a building unique.
>
> For level designers, this type of seeing can be transformative for how
> we learn from the levels of previous games---both good and bad. Doing
> this may involve breaking some habits common to game players. For
> example, gamers don't usually look up when playing games. As
> designers, the verti- cality of gamespaces can be an important element
> in establishing the gran- diosity of a setting or for communicating
> direction with players. For players, it is common to run directly to
> the next action scene rather than pause to explore game environments.
> Designers should look for ways to direct the pacing of a game
> environment in subtle ways---placing narrative elements in the way of
> player pathways or incentivizing exploration with rewards.
>
> In his book *Think Like an Architect*, Box proposes ten ways for
> explor- ing and understanding a building:

1.  Learn why a building was built, what it was for, and what it is now.

2.  Look up as you walk around---noticing visual elements, layering of
    forms, and materials.

3.  Sense the space by its size, shape, and how it interacts with light,
    sound, and other spaces.

4.  Train your eye to understand the structure of the building and how
    it holds the building up.

5.  Determine how materials are working---in compression or tension---
    or if they feel heavy or light.

6.  Determine how the building was constructed and from what materials.

7.  Examine the historical precedents of the building.

8.  Analyze the composition, proportions, and rhythms of building
    elements.

9.  Observe the appropriateness of the building to its setting.

10. Analyze what makes the building special from others.31

> Obviously, not all of these apply to game levels. While the
> environment art of a level can represent structures that are in
> compression or tension,
>
> the game art itself will not be. Many game levels are held up by the
> fact that they are not defined as rigid-body objects in the game
> engine, and thus do not fall according to the engine's physics system.
> However, many of these proposed ways of seeing are applicable to game
> levels in their current form, or may be modified slightly to fit our
> purposes. Level designers can modify their ways of seeing with the
> following methods:

1.  Identify what gameplay occurs in the space. What are the game
    mechanics supported?

2.  Look up as you walk around, noticing visual elements, especially art
    that contrasts the rest of the environment or somehow calls
    attention to itself. Also look down---is the space's verticality
    used in reverse to make you feel in danger?

3.  Sense the space by its size, shape, and how it interacts with light,
    sound, and other spaces. How do the lighting or sound conditions
    make you feel?

4.  Analyze the pacing of the level. Does the level usher you through
    itself quickly, or are there opportunities to explore? Are these
    required or bonuses for extra curiosity?

5.  Is there one gameplay style reflected in this level, or are multiple
    supported? (For example, does a deathmatch map have places for
    snipers, offensive players, defensive players, etc.? Does a game
    level play well for barbarians but poorly for mages?)

6.  How does the space express the narrative of the game? Is it a back-
    drop, or does exploring the level tell you about the game world in
    some way? Are narrative events scripted to occur around the player,
    or are there cutscenes?

7.  Examine any historical or gameplay precedents. What kinds of spatial
    experiences were in those games?

8.  Analyze the composition, proportions, and rhythms of environment art
    elements.

9.  How does level geometry compare with the movement abilities of your
    avatar? Is everything well within their capabilities, or does the
    level space challenge these measurements? Is there anything that

> is outside of these capabilities? If so, does the game offer any way
> to expand these abilities?

10. What environment art elements are repeated? Are they interactive? If
    so, do they correspond to a specific gameplay mechanic?

> These ways of seeing for level design, as well as the architectural
> and gamespace precedents found in the rest of this chapter, will guide
> our explorations of spatial design principles for level design.

## SUMMARY

> This chapter has been an introduction to the mindset of studying
> archi- tectural space, with insight into how game levels are designed.
> We dis- cussed how theory could be utilized to enhance our practical
> level design activities. We also discussed how exploring the
> principles of fields outside of game design can give us a framework
> from which to better understand existing gamespaces.
>
> To form the foundations of our studies throughout the book, we
> examined Vitruvian elements of architecture and discovered how they
> can help us frame our own elements of level design: functional
> require- ments, usability, and delight. These also framed our
> explorations of historic architecture through a number of
> civilizations. Our explora- tions followed an emphasis on the
> experiential elements of architectural design---use of architectural
> language, spatial sequences, communica- tive art, materials, and
> others---that will be useful as we move forward through the book. We
> also looked at the development of spaces within games, from board and
> physical games and play spaces to electronic games that evolved with
> expanding technology. We looked at how the design of these spaces was
> influenced by game elements: rules, settings, and the drive to create
> expansive worlds. In later chapters, we see how experiential elements
> of architecture can help us enhance our own game levels.
>
> Finally, we explored how we see spaces in both architecture and games.
> Following the suggestions of experienced architects, we formed ways of
> seeing for level analysis that will allow us to better identify the
> elements that create memorable level experiences. In Chapter 2, we
> explore methods not only for recording these analyses of architectural
> and level spaces, but also for constructing our own, both on paper and
> on the computer.
