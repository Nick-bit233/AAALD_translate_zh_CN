## EMERGENCE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

> There is nothing more emergent than the interaction between people. If
> emergent systems such as Conway's *Game of Life* are the result of
> exact and perfectly performed rules on a computer, they are much less
> dramatic than the interactions between human beings. Humans have
> moods, ups and downs, varying states of health, aches, pains, and
> varied personal histories that all influence how successful they are
> at interacting or playing with others.
>
> Let us once again consider Ubisoft creative director Jason
> VandenBerghe's player type model from "Applying the 5 Domains of
> Play."3 VandenBerghe's player personality elements were *openness to
> experience*, *conscientiousness*, *extraversion*, *agreeableness*, and
> *neuroti- cism*. The five domains of play were *novelty*, *challenge*,
> *stimulation*, *har- mony*, and *threat.* The player elements
> respectively correspond with:
>
> How players feel about entering into a game experience How they
> address tasks in the game
>
> Whether they play best alone or with others Whether they care about a
> larger narrative Personal sensitivity to in-game events
>
> Similarly, the domains of play correspond with factors of how game
> worlds are constructed:
>
> How many interesting things are there to see?
>
> Are challenges immediate and fast, or do they require practice?
>
> When obstacles are met, what amount of action do they call for and
> with how many people?
>
> Do we cooperate with others, or are they the obstacle?
>
> Do our actions in the game have agency to affect some larger narrative
> of the game world, or is the current session self-contained?
>
> What are the rules for discouraging bad behavior?
>
> Based on these factors alone, we can already see how design concepts
> for multiplayer worlds are generated. By entering design with a
> purpose, we can begin to build our worlds around how we want players
> within to interact with one another.
>
> Tabletop designer Jason Morningstar further addresses the emer- gence
> of multiplayer games in his East Coast Game Conference 2013 talk,
> "Tabletop Design Principles."4 Morningstar argues that rules in a game
> are just a small piece of the overall social system of multiplayer
> tabletop games. They "inspire as much as they constrain" players,
> merely facilitating and focusing interactions that players may have
> had anyway based on their personalities. Morningstar calls the
> interactions that occur between the explicit rules of the game and the
> personalities of individual players the "fruitful void."
>
> Morningstar's approach is much like the "experience is key" approach
> that we have been taking with level design. Apart from a core
> mechanic, there is also a *core shared experience* driving the design
> of multiplayer gamespaces. If one takes the core mechanics or genre of
> his or her multiplayer game---a shooter, MMORPG, persistent virtual
> world, etc.--- and asks the questions above of it, he or she can find
> a set of guidelines for
>
> designing his or her world. VandenBerghe's player personality elements
> allow us to out ourselves in the shoes of different types of players.
> For example, we might be tasked with creating a first-person shooter
> deathmatch level for multiple players. What sort of player would that
> cater to? On the VandenBerghe chart, let us say that the player
> prefers realism/ exploration in the novelty quadrant, not
> work/skilled5 in the challenge quadrant, mechanics/player vs. player
> (PvP) for the harmony quadrant, and thrill/multiplayer in the
> stimulation quadrant (Figure 9.1). Now that we have a theoretical
> player or player type, we should create a map that can best support
> this type of gameplay. Let us ask ourselves the domains of play-based
> questions from above to envision our multiplayer first-person shooter
> (FPS) deathmatch map:
>
> *How many interesting things are there to see?* There can be
> interesting things, but players often will not look at them for very
> long.
>
> *Are challenges immediate and fast, or do they require practice?*
> Challenges are immediate, as players will be quickly shooting at one
> another. Practice occurs over many matches.
>
> *When obstacles are met, what amount of action do they call for and
> with how many people?* Assuming even skill levels, the player with the
> better firing position or better gun will win.
>
> *Do we cooperate with others, or are they the obstacle?* In deathmatch
> every other player is an enemy.

>
> Though not a very technical process, we already have insight into what
> kind of map to create. The map does not have to have a lot of

> Players should not take very long to get to one another, and there
> should be nodes that channel player activity and allow for large
> battles. Perhaps some sort of interesting scenery or brighter lighting
> can be employed in the node areas. The level should have multiple
> floors so players can gain a prospect-refuge advantage over one

## LEARNING FROM URBAN EMERGENCE

> Cities are always the physical manifestation of the big forces at
> play: economic forces, social forces, environmental forces.
>
> The thing that attracts us to the city is the chance encounter, it's
> the knowledge that you'll be able to start "here" and end up "there"
> and go "back there," but that something unexpected will happen along
> the way.
>
> ---QUOTES FROM THE DOCUMENTARY FILM *URBANIZED*,
>
> DIRECTED BY GARY HUSTWIT7
>
> In many ways, cities are the ultimate emergent system: a collection of
> thousands, if not millions, of people brought together in a space. As
> the 2011 documentary film *Urbanized* highlights, cities are created
> and changed by, for, and sometimes even in spite of the wishes of
> inhabit- ants. Indeed, the destinies of cities are shaped by citizens,
> special inter- est groups, government officials, regulations, and
> economic and social forces. Due to these factors, studying cities,
> their design, and the history of urbanism can be helpful for game
> designers in understanding how space facilitates social interaction
> and gives players agency over the conditions of multiplayer
> gamespaces.
>
> As we saw in our explorations of Kevin Lynch's urban design princi-
> ples, cities utilize discreet elements---landmarks, paths, nodes,
> edges, and districts---to facilitate movement within. When considering
> the people part of this environment, Lynch's spatial rules also seem
> to aid human interaction: people gather around landmarks or run into
> one another on the paths between them, districts support different
> types of activity, etc. Perhaps more importantly, neighborhoods bring
> a sense of home and belonging. They also produce interpersonal
> relationships that make people
>
> feel safe from some of the negative emergent effects of cities: crime,
> van- dalism, and violence. Allowing for the organic mixing of human
> activities allows such neighborhoods or opportunities for interaction
> to occur. The history of urban design has even shown us examples of
> what happens when cities are not planned for facilitating positive
> interactions of residents.
>
> Modernism and Non-Emergent Cities
>
> In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the city was in
> a state of flux. Industrialization had packed people into cities
> looking for work, and cities had therefore become overcrowded. Rich
> landowners reacted to this demand for housing near industrial sites by
> packing as many people as possible into tenements for high rents. The
> result was urban slums like those lamented in the work of Charles
> Dickens and other nineteenth- century writers.
>
> It was in 1898 that urbanist Ebenezer Howard proposed the *garden
> city* plan in his book *Garden Cities of To-Morrow.*8 Howard's plan
> divided the city into concentric circle districts, which separated the
> functions of cities, living, working, gathering, moving, etc., from
> one another (Figure 9.3).

> FIGURE 9.3 A sketch reproduction of Ebenezer Howard's garden city plan

> district.
>
> The vision of this city was that work could be carried out in
> manufacturing districts, while housing could be placed among wide
> country green spaces where rent could be kept low. Travel between
> districts and between inter- linked garden cities would occur on large
> boulevards moving out from the center of the rings.
>
> The garden city movement had a great impact on modern architec- ture.
> In particular, Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier evangelized the
> idea of cities where the functions of living were separated. In 1922
> he conceived Ville Contemporaine (Figure 9.4), a city plan where
> inhabit- ants would live and work within skyscrapers located in the
> center of the city. Surrounding the skyscrapers were parks and large
> motorways, which were themselves surrounded by administrative
> buildings and universities.9 With Ville Contemporaine, Le Corbusier
> sought to create the city as a large garden and usher in an age
> focused on the car and airplane as common transportation types. He saw
> architecture and urban design as tools for social change and, along
> with Gerrit Rietveld, Karl Moser, and a number of other famous
> architects, founded the Congres International d'Architecture Moderne
> (CIAM) in 1928.10 This group was responsible not only for formalizing
> the rules of what is con- sidered to be the modern style of
> architecture, but also for promoting architecture as a tool for social
> and political change. Like Le Corbusier,

> they advocated for urban design to separate the functions of a city
> into discrete districts; architect Ellen Dunham Jones has described
> this as being "like modern graphic design" in the tendency to neatly
> arrange things.11
>
> CIAM disbanded in 1959, but its influence on modern architecture was
> widely felt. While mainly theoretical, several cities were designed by
> either CIAM architects or architects influenced by their ideas. Le
> Corbusier himself designed the plan for Chandigarh, India, as the
> first planned city after India's independence in 1947.12 Like many of
> Le Corbusier's theoretical plans, Chandigarh separated different
> functions into their own districts, with blocks for parkland,
> industrial areas, and government facilities. Initially, the city was
> largely empty, though today that has mostly turned around. Even
> recently, however, visitors have com- mented that the city is sparsely
> populated with pedestrians.13 Attractions such as Le Corbusier's Open
> Hand statue have had difficulty attracting visitors, but this is felt
> to be mainly due to government restrictions on visiting these sites.14
>
> Another separated-use city, Brasilia, Brazil, makes a somewhat more
> damning case against Modernist urban planning principles. The city has
> been described as "beautiful from an airplane, but a complete disas-
> ter on foot."15 Designed by Lucio Costa, the city separates living,
> work- ing, and administrative facilities among large super-blocks
> connected with highways. Between are vast green spaces designed to
> automotive scale. As a result, there are few opportunities for
> interaction between residents.16
>
> Perhaps the most often cited case against Modernist-inspired urban
> design is the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis, Missouri.
> Completed in 1954 and designed by Minoru Yamasaki, the complex
> consisted of thirty-three apartment buildings separated by streets and
> large green lawns. Pruitt-Igoe was originally planned as a publicly
> owned housing complex in which maintenance money would be generated
> from rent rev- enue from the low- and lower-middle-class residents.
> When new suburban communities enticed middle- and lower-middle-class
> citizens to leave the city, Pruitt-Igoe was left with only the poorest
> tenants, and therefore with little opportunity for maintenance
> income.17 The decay of the buildings was soon met with decreases in
> resident population and increases in crime rate. In 1972, demolition
> on the largely abandoned complex began, which was completed in 1976.18
> Detractors of Modernist planning cited Pruitt- Igoe's design
> philosophy---isolating the function of living from the rest of
>
> the city in favor of having large lawn spaces---as being a major
> factor in its downfall. Novelist Tom Wolfe commented:
>
> On each floor there were covered walkways, in keeping with Corbu's
> idea of "streets in the air." Since there was no other place in the
> project in which to *sin* in public, whatever might ordinarily have
> taken place in bars, brothels, social clubs ... now took place in the
> streets in the air.19
>
> These examples highlight what happens when interactive elements of
> space are separated from one another or have large areas of empty
> space between them. In cities, this can lead to isolation of residents
> and/or crime. In gamespaces, this has the potential to similarly
> isolate players from one another or make transitioning between two
> areas designed for different gameplay styles. While some isolation of
> the gameplay mechanics in an FPS map is helpful, could you imagine a
> map where areas for spawning or receiving ammunition are far enough
> away to make gameplay a chore? Could you imagine an online world where
> you go to one town to buy armor, another to buy potions, and yet
> another to receive quests?
>
> A lack of tightly defined mechanics for interaction can lead to anti-
> social behavior. In the early days of the *Ultima* series, Richard
> Garriott struggled with how to give players role-playing freedom while
> encourag- ing them to behave in socially positive ways within his
> worlds. For the single-player experience of *Ultima IV*,20 this led to
> the game's theme of becoming a virtuous avatar. An encounter with a
> player in the wilderness who was enacting the role of a thief a bit
> too well inspired Garriott to cre- ate the reputation system for
> *Ultima Online*, which kept violent players out of cities and allowed
> players to police themselves*.*21,22
>
> While these problems with separated interaction and the behavior of
> players in online worlds seem bleak, Garriott's solutions for
> mitigating his game's issues through player enforcement resemble urban
> design princi- ples advocated by a prominent American writer, mother,
> and advocate for neighborhood preservation.
>
> Jane Jacobs and Mixed-Use Emergent Neighborhoods
>
> In New York City after the Great Depression, a powerful influence on
> rebuilding the city's broken infrastructure was Robert Moses, an urban
> planner often called the master builder of New York. Moses was respon-
> sible for commissioning many large highways and bridge projects that
> ran
>
> through the city. These structures were responsible for breaking up
> several neighborhoods and leaving residents isolated from one another.
> He was also an opponent of public transit and tunnel projects, often
> opting for bridges and parkways even when other options were less
> disruptive to sur- rounding areas of the city.
>
> One of Moses' strongest opponents was Jane Jacobs, a writer who had
> lived in Greenwich Village since 1935. In the 1950s, Jacobs began
> writing for the magazine *Architectural Forum*, focusing on urban
> development stories. Following a trip to Philadelphia to cover
> developer Edmund Bacon and his urban design initiatives, Jacobs began
> to question contemporary urban design practices. She noted that
> Bacon's plans focused more on high-rise development on sites than the
> people's ability to use them, which contradicted her own urbanistic
> ideas: focusing on intimate neighbor- hoods and interactions between
> residents. In a lecture she would later give at Harvard University,
> she said, "Respect---in the deepest sense---strips of chaos that have
> a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of
> urban order."23
>
> Jacobs had become a major advocate for neighborhoods once her com-
> ments were published in *Architectural Forum*. In the late 1950s she
> success- fully fought against Robert Moses' plans to create an
> expressway through Greenwich Village. Her struggles with Moses
> continued over the course of the next decade whenever his plans
> resurfaced. Jacobs' most influential work in the field of urban design
> is the book *The Death and Life of Great American Cities*,24 which
> outlines Jacobs' own disgust with contemporary urban design principles
> focused on separated uses and large-scale devel- opment. The book
> instead advocates for preservation of intimate neigh- borhoods and
> social spaces.
>
> Key to Jacobs' arguments are her *four generators of diversity* in
> cities:

1.  Multiuse districts that encourage constant use by people

2.  Short blocks to allow easy access to amenities and exploration

3.  Buildings of varying age so as to vary economic factors

4.  Density of population25

> Jacobs' four generators can greatly influence how we design multi-
> player gamespaces to best emphasize the emergence created by the
> inter- action of multiple users. Jacobs uses the term *social
> capital*, arguing that
>
> the socialization that occurs between individuals in a space can yield
> both social and economic benefits.26 She cites how a density of people
> in pub- lic places reinforces its safety and develops relationships
> between users, if only in passing. Eventually, Jacobs' arguments and
> those of other user- focused urbanists such as Kevin Lynch would
> become vital to the New Urbanism movement, which emphasized walkable
> neighborhoods and multiuse districts.
>
> Using our level design vernacular developed throughout this book, it
> is possible to say that Jacobs' views are well aligned with game
> designers' seeking of emergent gameplay in multiplayer gamespaces.
> With a strong focus on planning for the sake of human users, Jacobs'
> outlook on design can be of great influence for designers of
> multiplayer spaces.
>
> Integrating Urban Design into Multiplayer Gamespace
>
> Level designers can take both the failures of Modernist urban design
> and the influences of new Modernism into account when addressing how
> players may use multiplayer gamespaces. Modeling multiplayer space
> design principles on Jacobs' own diversity generators and avoiding the
> pitfalls of Modernist use separations, it is possible to create *four
> generators of emergence* in multiplayer gamespaces:

1.  Multiuse gamespaces that give players access to a variety of
    mechanics (shopping, talking, fighting, recharging, etc.)

2.  Close proximity of functional spaces to one another

3.  Spaces for players of different styles, types, or factions

4.  Accommodation of player density

> To use multiplayer FPS games as an example once again, we may look at
> how one would model a capture-the-flag level under these principles.
> Capture-the-flag games divide players into two different teams, often
> red and blue, who compete to capture enemy flags and bring them back
> to their own base. Maps for this style of game are often symmetrical,
> with each team having a similar base on a far end of the map on either
> side of a wide prospect-scaled battle space. The Valhalla map from
> *Halo 3*27 is an excellent example of this style, with two bases on
> either end of a large gulch, featur- ing intermittent rocks and cliffs
> for both cover and sniping (Figure 9.5).

>
> gameplay styles: defensive shooting by players guarding their team's
> flag, offensive raiding for those attempting to capture the enemy
> flag, and runs from one base to another when the flag has been
> captured. These requirements also create opportunities for unique
> gameplay⎯some play- ers will prefer to hide and snipe into the space
> between the two bases, and others will take direct paths, fighting
> opponents head on. Diagrams of the Valhalla map, as shown in Figure
> 9.6, demonstrate our principles in this fashion. Both bases offer
> multileveled walkways rather than a direct path to the flag. Flags are
> cloistered on the bottom level of each base, allowing defensive
> players the choice to take refuge inside or snipe from upper levels
> that look out into the gulch. These bases also offer a variety of
> weapons for players to use: rifles, explosives, etc.
>
> The gulch between the two bases is also multiuse: players can use the
> tops of cliffs as sniping positions, or sneak between bases or into
> cover in the river at the bottom. A turret midway through the map
> offers players the option of gaining a strategic advantage over the
> other team, and becomes an important landmark for either attacking or
> defending forces when flags are being transported between bases. While
> the map as a whole is large, it does not take much time to traverse,
> so raids can be quick and battle is nearly constant. This largeness
> offers additional opportunities for the vehicle-based play that is
> part of the *Halo* franchise, and accommodates the many players that
> may be in one match. All of this combines to create exceptionally
> emergent styles of play.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF SPAWN POINTS AND QUEST HUBS

> Throughout the book, we have discussed the importance of pacing on
> games, alternating high and low action to create manageable gameplay
> and highlight exciting moments. While many multiplayer games avoid the
> quiet moments common in single-player experiences, the opportunity to
> refresh oneself is still a vital part of the experience. In this way,
> the places in which players appear on multiplayer maps, known as
> *spawn points*, and the places from which players embark on missions,
> which we will call *quest hubs*, are of great importance.
>
> Shaping with Spawn Points
>
> In previous explorations of emergent gameplay and possibility spaces,
> we discussed how games such as *Minecraft*29 introduce players to the
> possi- ble mechanics of the game through controlled experiences at the
> game's opening. As in single-player games, where first levels
> establish the rules of a world and introduce them to players, the
> places where players first encounter multiplayer spaces have a great
> impact on that player's possible strategies. The possibilities present
> in spawn points and hubs have a great impact on how players may
> approach their time in a multiplayer game: What weapons are near them
> as they spawn? What shops can they access? What are the opportunities
> for leveling up or improving their skills?
>
> The size of these spaces can greatly affect pacing. In action-oriented
> multiplayer games such as deathmatch shooter games, spawn points are
> small and offer a few nearby weapons to get a player moving
> along---there is no time to linger, only to jump into the game's
> action. For players appear- ing on a map, spawn points are often in
> defensible places isolated from main action nodes but close enough to
> them so the spawning player can rejoin the fight quickly, as shown in
> Figure 9.2 and other similar diagrams throughout the book.
>
> In the cooperative multiplayer shooter game *Left 4 Dead*,30 players
> begin each level in safe houses---sheltered areas with extra
> ammunition and health packs. These spaces are in many ways similar to
> spawn points in other shooter games, as they allow players to quickly
> recharge and go if they choose. However, they are largely inaccessible
> to the computer- controlled zombies in the game, and therefore allow
> players the opportu- nity to stay and plan their next moves. In this
> way, these spaces encourage socialization by letting players plan
> strategies for moving forward through *Left 4 Dead*'s gamespace. The
> game also features weapon and health caches throughout levels,
> especially before important large-scale battles.
>

> Shaping Player Interaction with Quest Hubs
>
> In many MMOs and online worlds, players often enter the gamespace in a
> centralized town or designated beginner's area. In *ActiveWorlds*,31 a
> persistent online world, players begin near coordinates 0, 0 on the
> world map and may move outward from there. Due to the large numbers of
> play- ers moving through this area, it has become an important in-game
> com- merce hub. *WoW* players begin in a starting settlement or town
> dependent on their chosen race. These towns have access to trainers
> for every class, as well as introductory quests specific to the
> player's chosen race. These activities give players a sampling of
> available character types they may choose and teach them how to play
> the game. They also facilitate the estab- lishing of unique play
> styles by giving access to the game's available classes. The starting
> areas in games like *WoW* work in much slower and more deliberate ways
> than spawn points in multiplayer action games do. These spaces are
> larger and meant to be carefully explored. They encourage interaction
> between players, as they are often laid out with a multitude of things
> to do and quests to undertake. The multiuser dungeon (MUD) *Federation
> II* (*Fed II*)32 utilizes carefully planned initial encounters with
> the game world to teach players how the game works and shape their
> interaction and gameplay. New *Fed* players are limited to exploring
> their starting planet until they can purchase a spaceship, which
> requires gain- ing a permit and bank loan by utilizing communication
> commands. This introduces players to some of the basic mechanics of
> the game and then allows them to venture further once they have
> mastered these mechanics. Because many of the economic systems that
> players must contend with to advance are player controlled, the social
> hierarchy of the world facilitates
>
> interaction with other players.
>
> In *Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and Narratives*,33
> Jeff Howard discusses quest hubs like those beginning MMOs or MUDs,
> along with similar spaces in single-player games. These hubs, he says,
> facilitate
>
> outward movement of players from inside hubs out into the larger world
> map through the use of quests or missions given by NPCs. Many of these
> missions require players to travel to other towns, which are
> themselves quest hubs. As such, these games use quests as a method by
> which to create tours of the game's possibility space. As players gain
> more power, movement between hubs and quest selection become easier,
> giving players more choice over their gameplay experience. Players may
> also unlock new mechanics as they complete quests.
>
> *Federation II*'s ranking system is based on this experience of
> travel, learning, and unlocking new abilities. Each new rank in the
> game opens opportunities to explore new territories and new game
> mechan- ics. For example, after the previously mentioned opening quest
> to get a spaceship, players must pay off that ship by performing
> cargo-hauling jobs for the Armstrong Cuthbert Company. These hauling
> missions act as a tour of the game's early planets, and also as
> opportunities for play- ers to visit social hotspots such as bars.
> Once players have completed the early hauling missions, they may
> venture further into space, encoun- tering other players. Eventually,
> as they move up in rank, they unlock access to the game's other
> mechanics---stock trading, managing compa- nies, and eventually
> administrating governments. At this point, players have become the
> influential characters that newer players will seek out for help.
>
> Enticing Exploration with Side Quests
>
> While emergence is certainly possible if players each have a list of
> primary quests to take on, more meaningful emergence can only come if
> players are allowed to customize their travels. For this reason,
> designers should offer players choices of tasks that are easily
> findable from their main paths. In many open-world games, the paths
> between main quests offer opportu- nities for side quests, tasks or
> missions that reward players for extra explo- ration. This type of
> structure is common in Bethesda Softworks games such as *Elder Scrolls
> V: Skyrim*, where the game world entices players with views of caves,
> tombs, towers, and other side quest locations while they travel
> between major quest hubs (Figure 9.8).
>
> Quest structures in multiplayer RPGs are different than single-player
> ones, as multiplayer games do not often have a central plot that is
> advanced by game quests. Some quests or player-defined tasks in
> multiplayer games may involve more time, players, traveling, and
> benefit than others. Bigger quests may therefore seem hierarchically
> more important. Some quests,

> FIGURE 9.8 This diagram of *Skyrim* shows how players are sent from
> one town to another. Side quests are easily found along the paths
> between main quest hubs. As such, main quests encourage travel to
> different parts of the world, within which players may freely access
> side quest content.
>
> such as reputation quests in *WoW*, are smaller repeatable tasks that
> contrib- ute to a larger-scale goal. Traveling to a bar and buying a
> round of drinks in *Federation II* is not a specific quest item, but
> it may reap social rewards and can therefore be considered a
> player-defined side quest. Multiplayer gamespaces should offer both
> large-scale main goals and opportunities for smaller player-defined
> goals. These give players opportunities to define how they spend their
> time in these worlds.

> Quest hubs form important nuclei to large game worlds. Players move
> outward from hubs and into quests and then return to hubs to refresh
> sup- plies, gain new weapons, or get new quests. In games that offer
> guilds, they may also be home bases for players to inhabit with social
> groups. We next explore the concept of a hometown in a game, and
> discover the benefit that players receive from having personalized
> territories.

## HOUSES, HOMES, AND HOMETOWNS IN GAMES

> While quests hubs act as facilitators of travel throughout games, many
> players may find themselves favoring specific territories based on
> their level, their progress through a game's story, or the social
> player groups that
>
> frequent these locations. Some games take this idea a bit further and
> allow players to have customizable places that become their own. The
> previous example of *ActiveWorlds* allows players to set up their own
> houses and shops, which helped create the commerce hub surrounding the
> world's entry point (Figure 9.9). *Second Life*34 allows players to
> craft their own houses and shops and even allows players to sell
> objects in the game.
>
> The ability of players to customize elements of games gives players
> addi- tional feelings of agency over the gameplay experience.
> Customization has been an element of gaming at least as far back as
> the advent of modern commercial wargaming, which is often attributed
> to the game *Little Wars* created by H.G. Wells in 1913.35 These
> games, such as those in the popu- lar *Warhammer*36 series, allow
> players to customize their own figurines with paint and other
> modifications, even as their stats are determined by common rules. In
> free-to-play mobile and social games, customization has proven a
> powerful moneymaking opportunity. In 2011, it was revealed that the
> economy for hats in the game *Team Fortress 2*,37 for example, totaled
> over \$50 million.38

> FIGURE 9.9 A map diagram of *ActiveWorlds* when it was known as *Alpha
> World* showing the world's urban sprawl mass as it emanated from the
> coordinate 0, 0. The area surrounding coordinates 0, 0 became an
> important commerce hub, as many players passed through there. The ease
> of remembering coordinates along the game's x axis (such as
> coordinates 3, 0), y axis (0, 3), or diagonals (3, 3) allowed these
> stretches to become similarly valuable as the world sprawled outward.
>
> Beyond the financial benefit to publishers of in-game customization,
> the ability for players to customize a part of multiplayer gamespaces
> also has social benefits. Jane Jacobs cites the importance of having a
> consistent feeling of familiarity with the people in one's
> neighborhood. Jacobs argues that the consistent presence of "public
> characters" such as shopkeepers and other residents helps them protect
> each other or facilitates intro- ductions between residents who are
> known to have common interests.39 Having consistent social groups of
> players is helpful for creating common emergent histories of gameplay
> events. Clans and guilds can be given the opportunity to meet in
> in-game social spaces such as towns or taverns. Supplementary spaces
> ancillary to games, such as chatrooms or forums, likewise allow for
> the organization of competitions, clans, and rivalries that give
> multiplayer games meaning.
>
> As mentioned, some game worlds allow players to design and build
> within them, creating their own home that others may visit. This is
> use- ful in games where the primary mechanic is socialization between
> play- ers, such as *Second Life*. *Second Life* allows players to
> shape the game world themselves. This allows user-created content to
> be attractions or allows for socialization through visiting one
> another's space. This free- dom has allowed multiple subcultures to
> evolve, such as those who use the customizable world for historic
> reenactments, cultural events, artistic exhibitions, or playing
> sports.
>
> *Animal Crossing: New Leaf* 40 utilizes the idea of in-game homes to
> facilitate interaction between players. Players are the mayor of their
> own town, and may customize it, their player avatar, and their own
> house as they wish. Social features of the Nintendo 3DS, such as
> wireless Internet access and StreetPass---a function that allows
> passing 3DS devices to com- municate and exchange data---allow players
> to visit each other's towns, exchange items, and give each other
> gifts. These features allow players to share their in-game
> achievements and help one another progress through the game by sharing
> resources.

## SUMMARY

> In this chapter, we have explored how understanding player personali-
> ties can inform decisions we make when creating gamespaces for multi-
> player games. Focusing on the development of player interactions
> rather than simply the execution of gameplay mechanics allows for
> gameplay to enter the fruitful void where interesting and memorable
> gameplay events occur.
>
> We also explored historic urban design examples to see how the
> interaction between large groups of people has been managed. We com-
> pared Modernist design principles that separated functions and New
> Urbanist principles that advocate for mixed-use user-focused urban
> spaces. We saw how the mistakes of the Modernists should not be
> repeated in our own multiuser game worlds, and how mixed-use
> gamespaces can facilitate the interaction between players of different
> skills, styles, and types.
>
> We saw how the structure of the spaces through which players enter
> multiplayer worlds, spawn points and quest hubs, affect player
> interaction with the world. Spawn points provide players with a quick
> opportunity to refresh resources before entering energetic multiplayer
> battles. Quest hubs encourage exploration, socialization, and
> introduce gameplay mechanics through carefully crafted introductory
> quests. These hubs also encourage the exploration of the larger game
> world, with quests often sending players to other hubs---cities,
> towns, planets, etc.---thereby giving players tours of the world.
> These travels also provide players with the opportunity for self-
> guided interactions and goals.
>
> Lastly, we discussed how the player's ability to customize his or her
> own place in these worlds, whether by establishing relationships with
> specific players or customizing his or her own surroundings,
> encourages a sense of belonging. These custom in-game "homes" also
> provide an incentive for socializing in games through visits or gift
> giving, allowing players to help one another progress in the game.
>
> In Chapter 10, we explore how sound design affects our perceptions of
> gamespace. Included are explorations of architectural rhythm, ambient
> sound, and spaces with little or no sound at all.

    instant gratification. However, many FPS players work very hard to
    become more skilled at their games, so in reality FPS deathmatches
    actually fall somewhere in the middle of not work and work.
