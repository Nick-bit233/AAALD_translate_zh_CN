## TEACHING THEORIES FOR GAME LEVELS

> In order to understand the spatial tools we will use to adjust player
> behav- ior, we must first understand the theories supporting these
> methodologies. As we have seen and will continue to see throughout the
> book, learning from other fields is an important part of the ongoing
> development of game design. Throughout this chapter, we will reinforce
> three models of teach- ing commonly considered by game
> designers---B.F. Skinner's *operant conditioning* model, the
> *Montessori method,* and *constructivism*---as the framework of our
> visual communication methodology.
>
> Behavior Theory and Operant Conditioning
>
> *Behavior theory*, also referred to as *behaviorism*, is the study of
> observable behaviors in organisms. John B. Watson established
> behaviorism as a school of thought in psychology with his 1913 article
> "Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It."4 Ivan Pavlov and his famous
> studies into *classical conditioning*--- wherein he would ring a bell
> before feeding his dogs, thereby causing them to salivate every time
> he rang a bell---were major influences for behaviorists.5 A major
> evolution of behaviorism came in 1937 when psycholo- gist B.F. Skinner
> coined the term *operant conditioning*. Skinner rejected Watson and
> Pavlov's earlier emphasis on reflexive or involuntary actions
>
> and "attributed a more active role to the learning subject."6 Operant
> conditioning involves changing voluntary actions of subjects via
> *positive and negative reinforcements*, as well as *punishments*.
>
> In Skinner's experiments with his *operant conditioning chamber*
> (widely known as the *Skinner box*) he had rats pull a lever in
> response to a specific stimulus, typically an auditory or visual
> signal (Figure 4.1). In the version of the experiment for studying
> positive reinforcement, when the rat pulled the lever in response to
> the signal, it would receive a food pellet as a *reward*. However,
> pulling the lever at the wrong time would elicit a punishment, often
> in the form of an electric shock to the rat's feet. The box could also
> study negative reinforcement, which teaches the subject to perform
> actions to remove unfavorable conditions. In the Skinner box
> experiment, a lever could be used to stop negative stimuli such as
> mild electric shocks or loud noises, thus strengthening the behavior
> of pulling the lever in the rats.7
>
> Skinner also wrote considerably for the field of education. The
> current system of grading students---rewarding success with good marks
> and punishing failure with poor ones---is often seen as an extension
> of his philosophies. Skinner himself argued for a methodology that
> avoided emphasis on lectures or tutorials, but rather on breaking
> large tasks into a series of smaller ones. As each task is performed,
> correct actions are reinforced so the student learns the proper way of
> performing his or her tasks.8 This methodology is also commonly
> applied to many games that seek to do away with extensive explanatory
> tutorials. When teaching mechanics in the first few levels of a game,
> such as is done in *Super Meat Boy*, gameplay mechanics are broken
> into individual tasks that are rein- forced and repeated. As we saw in
> Chapter 2, *Super Meat Boy*9 focuses

> Skinner-esque reinforcement and teaching models are commonplace in
> many game levels and puzzles. For example, solving puzzles or defeat-
> ing enemies is often met with in-game rewards such as resources or new
> items. Designers often structure gamespace *territories* in such a way
> that players must remove negative conditions---poison gas, constantly
> spawn- ing enemies, or enemy occupation---to make the territory safe
> for passage or to continue the narrative (Figure 4.2).
>
> The Skinner box model can be used to describe the repetition of one
> sin- gular action over and over again. As such, it has been used as a
> derogatory term for many newer game types, particularly games that
> force players to wait to perform one or two simple actions repeatedly,
> such as *Farmville*. For our purposes, we will look at operant
> conditioning as part of a larger palette of communication devices for
> educating players on how or when to utilize game mechanics.

> Game design is a second-order design problem,11 meaning that designers
> are communicating with players indirectly through their games. In this
> way, we can view our game levels as *prepared environments* of
> interactive objects for players to utilize. This is an important
> distinction for under- standing our next educational model for level
> design: the Montessori method.
>
> The Montessori method was developed by Italian physician and edu-
> cator Maria Montessori beginning in 1897. It emphasizes the senses as
> a medium for absorbing information that is then interpreted by the
> intel- lect into solutions to practical problems. Current Montessori
> standards enforced by the American Montessori Society (AMS) and
> Association Montessori International (AMI) highlight the classroom as
> a free learning environment prepared by a teacher, with multiage
> learning groups, choices of activities, and uninterrupted work and
> interaction time.12,13 Montessori education was accompanied by a set
> of *Montessori sensorial materials* that included blocks, cylinders,
> and other objects that would teach students how to utilize their
> senses to organize or arrange the objects (Figure 4.3). Similar
> objects, the Froebel gifts, were used in Friedrich Froebel's origi-
> nal *Kindergarten* in Bad Blankenburg, Thuringia, Germany. Frank Lloyd

> small, tall to short, etc.
>
> Wright famously received a set in his youth, citing the gifts as a
> major influence on his own architectural education.14
>
> In his book *Persuasive Games*, Ian Bogost suggests the Montessori
> method as an alternative view of how games teach players the
> traditional behaviorism-centered rhetoric.15 Montessori views of
> games, he argues, support the development of player skill and problem
> solving over the course of an entire game. In a game's early puzzles,
> such as the move- ment and battling ones found in the original
> Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) *Ninja Gaiden*,16 players learn
> the extent of player character Ryu Hayabusa's abilities that they can
> internalize and apply to later, more complex puzzles. Designers
> understanding this method of player learn- ing can focus early levels
> on teaching players how to deal with obstacles individually, and then
> mix and match them later to create more complex puzzles (Figure 4.4).
> This is especially useful if designers have created a set of modular
> gameplay assets that they can simply mix and match within their game
> engine environments.

> FIGURE 4.4 In *SWARM!*, the designers first introduced two basic
> puzzles in isolation---one where killing enemies opens gates and
> another where spinning a fan opens a gate---and then combined them
> into different orientations that players would have to figure out.
>
> This outlook on teaching in games differs from the operant
> conditioning model in that it does not directly address reinforcements
> or punishments as outcomes to solving in-game situations. The skill
> gates discussed in Chapter 2, where players cannot progress until they
> learn the ability that lets them overcome a particular obstacle, are
> examples of this kind of teaching. Skill gates are *self-reinforcing*,
> as players are simply stuck if, for example, they do not learn that
> jumping is a way to pass over a block that is in their way.
>
> Constructivism
>
> The last teaching method we will look at is *constructivism*.
> Constructivist models have origins in the work of theorists such as
> Montessori and oth- ers that advocate for sensory and activity-based
> learning methods. Other early influencers of constructivism, such as
> David Kolb, also advocate for reinforced feedback on the outcome of
> exercises.17 Constructivist learning models can be found in modern
> adult education classes and design or art schools. They are also
> popular in project and presentation-based course- work such as that in
> architecture schools. In many studio classes, students are guided
> through a design problem by teachers who oversee but do not directly
> intervene in a student's design actions. This combination of free- dom
> and feedback make constructivist methods a better individual descrip-
> tor of how players learn in games than either operant conditioning or
> the Montessori method alone.
>
> Kolb, along with Ronald Fry, outlined the following methodology for
> experiential learning: *concrete experience*, *observation and
> reflection*, *form- ing abstract concepts*, and *testing in new
> situations*18 (Figure 4.5). When taken as a methodology for
> understanding a player's interactions with a game, this can translate
> to *attempting to overcome an obstacle*, *observation and reflection
> of play outcome*, *forming strategies*, and *testing new strate-
> gies*. As pointed out by psychologist Pamela Brown Rutledge19 and game
> designer Jane McGonigal,20 games reinforce a cyclical model of problem
> solving through *self-efficacy*, an individual's belief in his or her
> ability to act and achieve positive results, and by encouraging risk
> through mini- mized setbacks.
>
> Constructivist teaching in level design combines Montessori and oper-
> ant conditioning learning in interactive systems of problem solving.
> As a designer, you create interactive environments and challenges for
> players to experiment with. Players, with the system you construct,
> then have the freedom to solve the problems you set up for them or
> even experiment with

> As they solve puzzles and problems, you set up places for the players
> to feel rewarded for their actions, reinforcing mechanics as they play
> through a game. Rewarding player action is important, as properly
> constructed challenges often require several playthroughs before they
> are overcome. Punishments such as dying or losing progress are also
> important for the constructivist model, but rather than a severe
> punishment or setback, players should be only set back to a point

> Combat games such as *Halo 4*21 excel at constructing iterative

> locations where a player can easily try a single challenge again
> rather than restarting a level completely. Additionally, recognizing
> enemies or their weapons allows players to form strategies based on
> knowledge from previous encounters.

> In practice, these three styles of learning are often used together to

> how to structure a series of puzzles or challenges over the course of
> a game so that players can deduce solutions by recognizing elements of

## SYMBOLS AND VISUAL DESIGN IN GAMES

> In the previous section, we delved into teaching methods for game
> levels--- behaviorism, the Montessori method, and
> constructivism---that allow
>
> us to create dialogs with players and teach them how to play our
> games. The common thread between these is that of the modular,
> reusable asset. In behaviorism, rewards and punishments are used to
> reinforce posi- tive and negative associations for different types of
> sensory information. Montessori learning and development over the
> course of a game hinges upon the player recognizing elements of
> previous activities, and finally, constructivism speaks to the concept
> of game levels as spatial puzzles that players must solve through
> trial-and-error learning of what each level element means.
>
> For reasons even beyond the ways they are constructed in develop-
> ment, games are well suited to these kinds of teaching. The key to
> teaching through visual communication in games is level geometry and
> environ- ment art: the 3D models, textures, pixel sprites, and other
> assets that are used to create believable environments in games. In
> this section, we will explore functions for environment art that
> transcend typical "cool objects that populate levels" understandings
> and delve into how environment art helps designers teach gameplay.
>
> Between 1928 and 1929, artist Rene Magritte created the painting *The
> Treachery of Images*22 (Figure 4.7), which depicts a smoking pipe and
> a caption underneath, *Ceci n'est pas une pipe* (this is not a pipe).
> Magritte, juxtaposing the image and caption, was making the
> self-referential state- ment that artists and designers do not create
> things, but instead create pictoral *representations* of things. The
> pipe is actually oil paint applied to a canvas in such a way that it
> forms the image of a pipe, not a pipe from which one can actually
> smoke tobacco.

> Piranha Plant from the game *Super Mario Bros.* (Figure 4.8).24 This
> ver- sion of the painting, whether intentional or not, applies
> Magritte's argument to objects in video games: they are not actual
> objects but are visual representations of objects. Paired with
> scripted behaviors, these in-game objects take on some of the
> behaviors of their real- world counterparts: swords and gun objects
> send damage to "enemy" character-objects, 3D models of first aid kits
> carry with them behaviors that increase a number related to player
> health, and so on. The pairing of visual art and procedural behaviors
> in game objects allows players to build strong associations between
> game objects and gameplay mechan- ics. These objects therefore become
> *symbols* of the gameplay mechanics they represent.
>
> Implementing Symbols in Games
>
> Symbols are a powerful tool in games, both as a construction method
> and in utilizing the teaching methods discussed earlier in this
> chapter. The prefabricated assets discussed in our previous examples
> of *Halo 4* and similar games are these very same types of symbols.
> For example, when *Halo* players see a Grunt, the most basic enemy in
> the game, they know what kinds of tactics they employ and how to
> defeat them. When designers put such enemies in a game, they typically
> have a few variations of the pre- fabricated enemy object that they
> litter around a level, meaning that not
>
> only will their behavior be consistent, but also the player will
> eventually build a literacy of their habits as defined by their
> scripted behaviors.
>
> The same is true of level objects and architecture. As we have seen in
> our brief explorations of Unity and other engines, an efficient way to
> con- struct levels is to reuse prefabricated assets. Once these are
> created, the designer can use and reuse them throughout his or her
> games. The player will also recognize the objects and associate them
> with a specific gameplay mechanic. In *Halo*, players attacking the
> enemy forts may see a purple plat- form floating in the air. This
> object, used throughout the game, typically features an enemy sniper.
> After one or two experiences seeing this object, they will see it as a
> symbolic indicator that they will be battling a sniper.
>
> For environment art-intensive games, it is important to establish what
> portion of the scenery is a gameplay symbol and what is simply
> environ- ment art. For example, *L.A. Noire*25 features an extensive
> environment that simulates the city of Los Angeles in 1947. However,
> only certain buildings are important to gameplay, and not all can be
> interacted with. The design- ers distinguish interactive buildings
> from non-interactive buildings by coloring the knobs, handles, or
> other entry hardware of the interactive buildings a gold color.
>
> The difference between *L.A. Noire*'s interactive doors and non-
> interactive doors goes far beyond the color of their doorknobs. As
> game objects in an engine, the interactive doors would most likely be
> 3D mod- els with some sort of script attached that dictate how they
> respond to player interactivity---either working with
> collision-interaction scripts attached to the player or entirely
> driven by the door's own artificial intel- ligence. Alternatively, the
> non-interactive doors are just that: 3D models of doors or simply part
> of a larger 3D model of a building. These objects are just environment
> art---their interactivity consisting of only their abil- ity to block
> players from passing through them.
>
> In summary, it is important to follow two rules when building environ-
> mental symbols in games:

1.  Each symbol must have a unique appearance, even from similar
    environment art objects.

2.  Each symbol must be repeated so the player learns what it means
    through repetition.

> Following these two rules will allow you to use prefabricated game
> objects as elements of your game's *visual language*. As the player is
> exposed
>
> to your language, he or she will gain literacy of it, knowing how to
> read it as he or she plays.
>
> Teaching with Symbols in Games
>
> Architect Adolf Loos, in a 1910 lecture, famously argued, "Ornament is
> a crime."26 The rationale for this, argued in rebuttal to the ornate
> art nouveau movement, was a belief that ornament could limit an
> object's stylistic longevity, and that the use of ornament was
> therefore unethical. This mindset helped solidify the visual style of
> architectural Modernism, which often featured clean, plain surfaces
> and straight lines.
>
> Many of Loos's arguments were focused around ornament as frivolous
> aesthetic detail. However, as we showed earlier, our own use of
> environ- mental objects in games can go beyond mere ornamentation and
> become symbols: visual objects that carry representative associations
> with ideas or gameplay mechanics. Games teach through several methods,
> often in tan- dem with one another at one time. The repeatability of
> prefabricated game objects used as gameplay symbols allows these
> objects to become enforc- ers of the previously studied teaching
> methods: operant conditioning, the Montessori method, and
> constructivism.
>
> *Introducing Symbols in First Levels*
>
> First levels of games are excellent for studying how games introduce
> the visual symbols that will form their gameplay language. As we saw
> in discussions of both *Super Mario Bros.* and *Super Meat Boy*, these
> games introduce symbols in the form of actual game objects or level
> geometry arrangements by allow- ing players to interact with them
> through their avatar's abilities (Figure 4.9). In the example of
> *Super Meat Boy*, players learn in level 1-2 that vertical walls are
> interactive and may be gripped by Meat Boy. This is repeated as part
> of several other puzzles and rewarded by the players reaching Bandage
> Girl at the end of each level. Likewise, players of *Super Mario
> Bros.* will learn to jump at blocks from underneath after being
> rewarded with coins and power- ups. As players progress through the
> game, they will see these symbols again and know what they do because
> of these first few conditioned encounters.
>
> In *SWARM!*, the ball-rolling platform game explored in Chapter 2, the
> developers had the challenge of introducing an unconventional core
> mechanic to players: luring enemies into traps instead of fighting
> them directly. This mechanic was further used to unlock doors that
> would open when all enemies in an area were defeated. To teach the
> relationship between the player, enemies, and environmental puzzles,

> Later, enemy spawn points were set up in an area surrounded by traps,
> so play- ers could watch the enemies hit the traps and explode.
> Finally, the player was put in a situation where he or she could lead
> the enemies into the traps, which would open a door (Figure 4.10). The
> three pieces of this last puzzle---trap, enemies, and door---were all
> located within one screenshot's view of each other so players could
> easily see their relationship. In further iterations of this puzzle,
> the designers could place the elements further apart, already making
> the relationship between puzzle elements clear.
>
> Likewise, introducing new puzzle elements by controlling how the
> player views them (all within one screen in the case of *SWARM!*)
> proved to be a valuable method for these designers.27
>
> *Symbols as Guides*
>
> As we have seen, symbols are important tools for not only introducing
> mechanics early, but also for conveying the message of what actions to
> take throughout entire games. *Portal*28 makes excellent use of
> environmental symbols to indicate gameplay mechanics. On the one hand,
> there are cau- tion signs at the beginning of the game's test chamber
> puzzles that describe what hazards are inside. As players visit new
> rooms, see the symbols, then play the rooms themselves, they learn
> which symbols correspond to spe- cific mechanics. Another layer of
> symbol occurs within the level geometry itself, where specific layouts
> of wall panels and masses are arranged accord- ing to the metrics of
> specific actions. As such, a player who enters a room and sees signs
> that indicate inertia-based puzzles, and then encounters the deep pit,
> wide canyon, and tilted wall panels consistent with the game's inertia
> puzzles will know what actions to take (Figure 4.11).
>
> *Portal* demonstrates how these early encounters with symbols help
> designers implement Montessori and constructivist-style models in game
> levels. As the game is highly modular, elements are used and reused
> through- out the experience, but shuffled in new and interesting ways.

> textures, which each have their own material properties related to how
> they interact with portals, are symbolic: a white finish indicates
> that the surface will accept a portal, and a black shiny finish
> indicates that the player cannot place portals there. In this way,
> each room develops a rich dialog with play- ers as they experiment and
> iterate new ways of solving each puzzle through geometry, texture, and
> symbol. Utilized in this way, newly encountered level environments act
> like new parts of a conversation for a player to engage in. As players
> learn what each symbol means, they will train themselves to search for
> them as indicators of what to do next in your game levels.
>
> Designing and Placing Symbols for Effective Communication
>
> As we have seen, establishing what objects are and are not symbols, as
> well as what each symbol stands for, is important for visually
> communicating with players. We have also seen that symbols must stand
> out from other pieces of environment art, such as *L.A. Noire*'s gold
> doorknobs or *Portal*'s white wall finishes. Good principles of visual
> communication are vital not only for the aesthetic quality of each
> symbol, but also to make them stand out from other, non-symbolic
> pieces of environment art.
>
> Visual communication can aid level design in other ways. The most
> important is guiding players through environments. As we saw with our
> studies of Kevin Lynch's urban design principles in Chapter 3,
> landmarks and other noticeable geometries can help players orient
> themselves in large environments. However, other subtler principles
> implemented in a game's environment art can help players find their
> way through more intimate spaces.
>
> *Basic Color Theory*
>
> In many games, *color* is a vital tool for communicating with the
> player. There are two reasons for this: the ways in which colors

> FIGURE 4.12 (See color insert.) In the additive color model, the
> primary colors of light---red, green, and blue---are combined to form
> new colors, and eventually white light when all three are combined.
>
> Other color models include the *additive* color model, which is based
> on how light behaves, and the *subtractive* model, which is used in
> painting and printing. Additive color is based on *primary colors* of
> red, blue, and green. If one looks at a color monitor or television up
> close, he or she can see that each pixel is comprised of a red, blue,
> and green element. Adding these primary colors to one another forms
> different colors, which even- tually create white when all three
> primary additive colors are combined (Figure 4.12). Due to the way
> this model works, digital art programs have a color mode called *RGB*
> for creating graphics to be displayed on a screen (like many images
> and textures used for video games).
>
> The subtractive model is based on two different sets of primary
> colors: red, yellow, and blue (RYB), or cyan, magenta, and yellow
> (CMY). When either of these combinations of colors are combined, they
> form black. CMY is commonly used for three-color printing and
> graphics. However, it is RYB that gives us the commonly understood
> *color wheel* (Figure 4.13) of the three primary colors and their
> *secondary* and *tertiary colors*, which forms our basis of how we use
> colors in relation to one another.
>
> The color wheel is an important tool for level designers. Groupings of
> three adjacent colors on the wheel are said to be *analogous* colors,
> which can help create a harmonious atmosphere based on a particular
> mood. For example, using blue, blue-purple, and purple together can
> create a somber or cold feeling in a level. Using *complementary*
> colors---colors opposite one another on the color wheel---can create a
> powerful effect, which we will discuss in the next section, on
> contrast.

> FIGURE 4.13 (See color insert.) The color wheel. Groups of three
> colors next to one another are known as analogous colors, while colors
> on opposite sides of the wheel are complementary. Using complementing
> colors in visual design helps contrasting elements stand out.
>
> It is also important to understand metaphorical associations that
> particular colors have gained over time. For example, the color combi-
> nation of blues and purples was said to create a cold feeling.
> Likewise, a combination of red, red-orange, and orange creates a warm
> or hot feeling. Besides temperature, colors can stand for emotions⎯in
> Western culture, red is seen as analogous with passion or love, blue
> is sadness or tranquility, yellow is happiness, etc. These
> associations carry over to games: one typi- cally sees red or green
> health items, due to these colors' associations with blood, medicine,
> or growth. Blue is the color of magic or mana in many games, having a
> mystical association. Green is also used in many contexts of alien
> creatures or monsters thanks to associations with nuclear materi- als
> or swamps. Level designers would be wise to pay attention to these and
> other color associations when planning their game environments.
>
> *Contrast*
>
> An element of using not only color, but also shape, object size, and
> other visual elements of game worlds, is *contrast*. Contrast is the
> juxtaposition of objects such that one is meant to be directly
> opposite another in some quality such as size, color, shape, or style.
> When a designer uses contrast, it is typically to call attention to
> the unusual element. Common con- trasts include using a bright object
> among darker ones, coloring an object
>
> a complementary color to the predominant color of a scene, or putting
> a tall object among a collection of short ones.
>
> Using complementary color to create contrast is commonly used in games
> like *Bioshock Infinite*.30 The chapel where player character Booker
> DeWitt enters the floating city of Columbia is predominantly blue and
> dimly lit. Each room has multiple passages into other rooms, but ones
> on the main path that will lead players out of the chapel contain
> bright elements such as a worshipper in white robes (to contrast the
> lighting con- dition) or orange lighting (to contrast the predominant
> color of the envi- ronment). The other passages, which often contain
> collectable resources, are analogous colors to the blues of the scene:
> purples and blue-purples.
>
> As we saw in Chapter 3 during the discussion of Kevin Lynch's urban
> design elements, contrast is an important factor in leading players
> through a game environment. As we discussed the radio tower area of
> *Half-Life 2: Episode 2*, we saw that bright, warm-colored textures
> contrasted the cool blues and greens of the surrounding landscape as
> well as the dark browns and blacks of the surrounding buildings.
> Contrast is important for creat- ing landmarks not only in large,
> exterior environments, but also within individual rooms and hallways,
> as shown in *Bioshock Infinite*.
>
> *Framing*
>
> Another element of visual design of great use to level designers is
> the concept of *framing*. Framing describes the use of foreground
> elements to surround the view of something important in an environment
> as though it were in a frame (Figure 4.14). Framing is a technique
> useful for enhancing the approach to important game environments: as
> the player moves through a gamespace, framed openings or expansions of
> space can enhance or foreshadow the player's arrival at a point.
>
> This simple but crucial aspect of visual composition is an effective
> tool for turning environmental transitions into guideposts. Combined
> with environmental techniques such as color theory and contrast,
> pathways and arrivals in games can be easy to navigate and dramatic.
>
> *Bioshock Infinite*'s introductory gamespaces provide a powerful exam-
> ple of framing. Important architectural areas along the player's
> intended path are framed with colorfully lit embellishments: embedded
> columns and sculptural ornaments. These pieces of environmental
> artwork also feature engraved sayings by famous in-game
> figures---building the char- acterization of the game's alternate
> America through embedded environ- mental narrative.

> FIGURE 4.14 Vertical elements such as trees, columns, or doorframes
> are effec- tive at helping designers frame scenes, adding to the drama
> of environmental transitions and approaches.
>
> *Rule of Thirds*
>
> The last visual design concept we will highlight here is the *rule of
> thirds*. The rule of thirds dictates that a designer should divide an
> image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (creating nine
> total divisions), and then place elements of the composition along the
> lines (Figure 4.15). This produces more visually interesting
> compositions than if the designer had simply centered the subjects.
>
> This concept is based on the idea that a visual composition should
> allow viewers' eyes to travel around the image rather than stay in one
> place. Subjects placed at the dividing lines in a rule of thirds image
> will keep the viewer's eyes moving around an image rather than staying
> at the center. Moving objects off center can help designers change the
> balance of an image or imply movement.
>
> In game levels, subtle shifts of level objects to the side of a view
> can create more visually interesting lines of sight. In
> Thatgamecompany's *Journey*,31 the player character tends to occupy
> the first third of the screen. In the first level, the player
> character is placed to the left of centrally placed landmarks.
> Elements placed to the sides of the centrally located markers, such as
> those found in the game's first screen, for example, direct

> FIGURE 4.16 This sketch of the first level of *Journey* shows how
> visual elements are placed in thirds on screen, including the player
> character itself. The off- centered elements direct the player gaze to
> the landmark in the center of the view.
>
> the player's gaze toward important elements (Figure 4.16). Other
> markers require players to move slightly right or left, creating a
> more interesting path than if the player simply had to move straight.
> At the end of each of these shifts in path are also game objects that
> become symbols of specific mechanics, so the *visual rhetoric* of the
> scene is incredibly rich from both the visual composition and
> symbol-making standpoints.
>
> Symbols are indeed an important element of teaching in levels with
> visual communication. Through the teaching methods we have explored,
> designers can introduce and reinforce the meaning of symbols or
> familiar level geometries. Effective uses of color, contrast, and
> composition allow symbolic geometries to stand out from other parts of
> a gamespace. In the next section, we will learn how preformed symbolic
> associations with architectural forms may also be used to communicate
> with players in large game worlds.

## ARCHITECTURAL FORMS AND TYPES

> We have just discussed how game objects and level may be utilized to
> create visual symbols that evoke associations with gameplay mechanics.
> When teaching a player how to play your game with environments, these
> associations must be built through a combination of training methods
> such as those previously discussed. However, there are also symbolic
> asso- ciations derived from everyday architecture that are used to
> guide players in games: architectural *types*.
>
> Architectural types describe a building's use through its *form*
> (Figure 4.17). In many cultures, buildings of the same use are built
> with similar forms. Over time, the form becomes associated with the
> build- ing use, and a type is established. For example, a square
> building with a pitched roof is often understood as a house in Western
> cultures. Likewise, *torii*, Japanese gates, would conjure strong
> associations with temples to a Japanese person. Like symbols, formal
> building types carry strong asso- ciations of ideas beyond the
> architecture itself.
>
> In games, building types can serve a similar purpose to their
> real-world counterparts. Games in the *Dragon Quest*32 series (known
> as *Dragon*

> FIGURE 4.17 These shapes represent different building types in Western
> culture. Based on societal associations of building use with building
> form, types allow observers to understand their environment.
>
> *Warrior* in the United States until 2005) often utilize building
> types to help players find their way around in-game towns. Like
> symbols, these types are associated with gameplay through training and
> demonstra- tion. For example, players of *Dragon Quest* games who need
> to resurrect fallen party members or remove curses must find a
> church---the game- play functions of which are removing status effects
> and saving the game. As a formal type, churches can be recognized by
> the religious symbols incorporated into their architectures---stars,
> crosses, and others---similar to how symbols are displayed on real
> churches and temples (Figure 4.18). These types often borrow heavily
> from the forms of real-world architec- tural types to communicate
> their purpose. Churches in *Dragon Quest*, for example, often
> incorporate formal elements such as a narthex or apse in their plans
> (especially in earlier games where the exteriors of build- ings were
> not shown) or aesthetic elements like stained glass or religious
> symbols.
>
> Even more overt are the types used in the *Pokémon*33 series. Like
> many role-playing games (RPGs), each town contains several consistent
> build- ing types with different gameplay functions. In *Pokémon*, this
> includes a Pokémon Center for healing and communicating with other
> players, a Poke Mart for buying items, and often a Pokémon Gym
> containing one of the game's bosses. As in *Dragon Quest*, these
> buildings are rec- ognizable by their outward appearances consistent
> with their architec- tural type. Unlike many early *Dragon Quest*
> games, however, building types in *Pokémon* games often utilize the
> same sprite or 3D model for

> games demonstrate building types as modular assets: the buildings
> communi- cate through their building type and are reusable from town
> to town. Even more graphically sophisticated games like *The Elder
> Scrolls V: Skyrim*34 utilize consistent assets when communicating
> building type: smithies have anvils and stoves, merchants can be found
> in booths or behind counters, and horses can be bought at barn-like
> stables. While *Skyrim*'s wealth of detail allows many buildings to be
> unique, consistent elements like those mentioned above still allow
> these buildings to com- municate their function to players.
>
> Now that we have explored the different types of visual and architec-
> tural symbols in games, as well as the teaching methods through which
> we can train players with them, we can explore how teaching and visual
> arts work together in actual gamespace applications.

## TEACHING GAMEPLAY THROUGH ADVERTISING METHODS

> In his book *Persuasive Games*, game designer Ian Bogost discusses how
> methods from the field of advertising can help designers communicate
> with players through visual and procedural means.35 Bogost describes
> three methodologies: *demonstrative advertising*, *illustrative
> advertising*, and *associative advertising*. These methods are
> extremely important to level designers, as they describe different
> methods of how we can com- municate information to players. In this
> section, we will explore what each method of advertising is and how it
> represents a different style of communication.
>
> Demonstrative Advertising with Scripted Events and Triggers
>
> The first of these methods described by Bogost is demonstrative
> advertis- ing. Ads that practice demonstrative advertising typically
> show a product, describe how it is used, and tell how it can help the
> consumer (Figure 4.19). When advertising video games, for example,
> this advertising style takes the form of "back-of-the-box"
> descriptions of a game that describe the number of levels or list a
> game's features. Products such as cars or tools often use
> demonstrative advertising to show the utility of the product for the
> user.
>
> Demonstrations can be a powerful tool for communicating gameplay
> information to players. We can build associations between gameplay
> sym- bols and gameplay actions through controlled interactions with
> in-game objects. A demonstration of a certain gameplay element that
> players can watch but cannot directly interact with can also be an
> important tool
>

> FIGURE 4.20 In-game demonstrative scenarios show players how hazardous
> gameplay elements work in a safe way so that players can build
> associations.
>
> for demonstrating potentially dangerous obstacles or enemy encounters.
> These demonstrations occur when a player is in view of a dangerous
> obstacle, but far enough away that the player cannot interfere with
> the demonstrative action. For example, the *Half-Life* series
> typically uses demonstrations to introduce players to the barnacle
> enemy---a stationary alien character that eats any creature
> unfortunate to get stuck to its long tongue. Rather than introducing
> the player to these enemies by letting him or her get caught in the
> trap, which could be potentially disorienting and create a negative
> gameplay experience, the designers chose to allow players to watch
> another creature get caught before they themselves reach the barnacle
> (Figure 4.20).
>
> In *SWARM!*, the method for destroying enemies---luring them into
> electrified traps---is introduced by placing the traps between the
> approach to a room and the enemies' spawn point (Figure 4.21).
> Building these dem- onstrations in game engines involves careful
> placement of *scripted game*

> FIGURE 4.21 *SWARM!* introduces the indirect way players must kill
> enemies by placing traps between the player's entry point to a room
> and the enemy spawn points. Many demonstrations are based on the
> timing of scripted events and the placement of event triggers.
>
> *events*, gameplay events that are controlled and activated through a
> game engine's internal logic-building language. Like many scripted
> in-game events, demonstrations also require the use of triggers,
> invisible collision objects that activate scripted events when the
> player character passes through them. Like other gameplay elements,
> carefully understanding or defining the metrics of how triggers and
> scripted events work (adjusting the distance of a trigger against the
> time it takes for the triggered event to occur, adjusting the size of
> triggers, etc.) is vital for setting up a successful demonstration of
> gameplay.
>
> While in-game demonstrations involve objects that must be carefully
> constructed so they create specific gameplay experiences, the other
> adver- tising methods are much less concrete in how they engage
> players.
>
> Illustrative Advertising through Environmental Narrative
>
> Like demonstrative advertising, illustrative advertising shows the
> product in the ad. However, unlike demonstrative advertising,
> illustrative advertis- ing omits information on how the product is
> used or what features could be helpful to consumers, and instead shows
> the product in an appealing context. This is the "sex sells" method of
> advertising, where a product is shown being used by someone who then
> gains favor with members of the opposite sex. This type of advertising
> is about promoting a product based on building its image⎯this car
> helps you look good at fancy clubs, that
>

>
> FIGURE 4.22 Illustrative advertising shows a product in an appealing
> context so the viewer builds associations between the product and an
> image he or she would like to possess.
>
> cologne will attract beautiful women, our detergent will make your
> family happy, etc. (Figure 4.22).
>
> Within games, illustrative advertising can be accomplished by building
> symbols through *environmental narrative detailing*. In *Half-Life
> 2*,36 for example, it is established that the lambda symbol (λ) is
> associated with the heroic resistance movement through environmental
> and contextual clues---the symbol is used on the player character's
> armor, in friendly bases, etc. As the player progresses through the
> game, he or she encounters the symbol many times, typically near
> caches of helpful items or breaks in long action sequences. Similarly,
> *Resident Evil 4* utilizes ominously crafted signposts before enemy
> territories, traps, or encounters. After sev- eral iterations of
> signpost = danger sequences, the player learns that the signs are a
> warning by the level designers that something dangerous is about to
> occur. Like *Half-Life 2*'s use of λ, the designers craft a symbol by
> illustrative means, reinforcing that signposts are followed by danger.
> Used in conjunction with behavioral and Montessori teaching methods,
> illus- trated symbols become a powerful teaching tool in games.
>
> Associative Advertising as Deconstruction
>
> Associative advertising is the least concrete of the advertising
> methods dis- cussed by Bogost. Like illustrative advertising, it
> builds a product's image by associating it with an appealing
> environment. However, associative
>

> height="1.88in"}
>
> FIGURE 4.23 Associative advertising works similarly to illustrative
> advertising, but omits the advertised product entirely in favor of
> building an image for the product.
>
> advertisements show only the context and leave the product's usage to
> the viewer's imagination. These kinds of advertisements are popular
> with car, beer, liquor, and cigarette companies, with their ads often
> showing implied users enjoying the company of friends, attending
> stylish parties, or fulfilling male power fantasies (Figure 4.23).
>
> Associative advertising is the product of centuries of development in
> how advertisements are employed. Many early nineteenth- and twentieth-
> century ads featured lots of copy describing how a product is used.
> Over time, advertisers focused on quick, eye-catching image-building
> ads over descriptive ones---the result of consumers gradually spending
> less time interacting with each single advertisement.37 Likewise,
> associative methods within games are the result of the designer
> building a system of information over the course of a game. As players
> are taught how symbols, sounds, or game objects correspond to gameplay
> through demonstrations, reinforce- ment, or other methods, they learn
> the game's visual and auditory language. Players can, through
> Montessori learning, internalize how a game's sym- bolic communication
> system works and interpret even small variations on established
> patterns if they recognize familiar elements. Associative methods in
> games allow designers to show a symbol to communicate that the
> associated gameplay is nearby, even as the designer increasingly adds
> obstacles between symbol and associated element (Figure 4.24). This
> can be used, in a way similar to *Half-Life 2* and *Resident Evil 4*,
> not only to build symbol = gameplay relationships, but also to
> deconstruct familiar gameplay elements or subvert established
> patterns.

> FIGURE 4.24 Building strong associations in games allows designers to
> increas- ingly deconstruct the symbol = gameplay relationship. In this
> example, a symbol that indicates nearby rewards is placed farther and
> farther from the payoff. Building associations allows for gameplay
> elements to be mixed and matched with other puzzles or hazards.
>
> *Limbo* excels at this type of deconstruction by playing its
> silhouetted art style against a player's relationship with established
> gameplay con- ventions. In an early puzzle, players encounter a large
> press with what appears to be a raised button directly underneath.
> Gameplay conventions dictate that the raised portion must be the
> button that operates the press, so the player should avoid it to stay
> alive. However, when the player moves next to the button so he or she
> may jump over it, he or she learns that the depressed ground next to
> the button is actually the mechanism that acti- vates the lethal press
> (Figure 4.25).
>
> Such subversions could even be utilized in gameplay narratives.
> Imagine a scenario where in a *Half-Life 2* map, the player encounters
> what appears to be a friendly base and must choose whether to trust

> base is a trap. Such scenarios can provide the player with exciting

## CONTROLLING INFORMATION IN MEMORY PALACES

> As we have seen, gamespaces can contain a great deal of information
> that is not only stored, but also communicated to players in both
> overt and subtle ways. In this way, these spaces can be considered
> *memory palaces*. Memory palaces were a pneumonic device employed by
> Cicero, the Roman orator, philosopher, and statesman, for remembering
> the content of his speeches.38 Also called the *method of loci*, this
> technique has users constructing a palace or other architectural space
> in their mind, with each room, having its own unique architectural
> style, representing a piece of information. As the orator speaks, they
> imagine themselves moving from room to room---from talking point to
> talking point.
>
> Chapter 3 mentioned the customization features of games like *Second
> Life*, which allowed users to create digital museums or sculptures for
> pre- senting information to other players. *Minecraft* and *Little Big
> Planet* users often erect elaborate structures as monuments to their
> favorite media franchises,39 explorations of theoretical systems,40 or
> even as working computers.41 These types of structures are pervasive
> in digital games as functional systems of communication: displaying
> the ideas of designers for others to see.
>
> It is through these kinds of knowledge embedding in game levels that
> we can utilize gamespaces as instruments with which to create
> emotional experiences for players. In their book *Chambers for a
> Memory Palace*,42 Donlyn Lyndon and Charles W. Moore describe how
> pieces of archi- tecture can become memory palaces through the use of
> memorable
>
> communicative moments. In many ways, these pieces of architecture can
> help level designers manipulate the type and amount of information
> that they transmit to players: plot elements, enemy and obstacle
> locations, puzzle components, etc. In *Rules of Play: Game Design
> Fundamentals*,43 Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman describe three levels
> of information contained within games: *certainty*, *uncertainty*, and
> *risk*, based on the work of mathematician Richard Epstein. Through
> different methods for creation of emotional experiences in game
> levels, designers can care- fully pace how players experience these
> levels of information in games. Before we explore the emotional
> experiences possible through using architectural experience concepts,
> we must understand these levels of information.
>
> Certainty
>
> The first level of information described by Epstein, and by extension,
> Salen and Zimmerman, is certainty. A certain game is one in which the
> outcome is known. Salen and Zimmerman point out that in terms of
> measuring game outcomes, a game with a certain outcome is hardly a
> game at all. It is indeed far less exciting to watch a practiced
> player defeat a novice in a multiplayer video game or to see a sports
> team get completely shut out by its more skilled opponents.
>
> On a more micro-level in a game, creating certainty within levels
> through consistent level elements can be a powerful tool for enticing
> players to explore or continue playing. Much of this chapter has been
> devoted to understanding symbol making and the use of modular assets
> in communicating gameplay elements through visual systems. As players
> learn how to recognize symbols in games, they will also learn to
> recognize the conditions under which those symbols reveal themselves.
> In games such as *Super Metroid*,44 for example, rooms for recharging
> weapons are typically placed near rooms containing boss enemies. Also,
> a reward of some kind (typically in the form of a new weapon or
> ability) is placed after the boss room. This *pattern* is established
> early in the game and continued throughout.
>
> Horror games such as *Dead Space*45 establish patterns with their save
> rooms. While the overall tone of the game is one of dread and horror
> at the possibility of enemies jumping out at any time, the game's save
> rooms are established as safe zones early on in the game. This is done
> without expo- sition or other narrative devices, but simply through
> the player's experi- ence of encountering a number of save rooms that
> do not contain enemies. Examples such as this and those found in
> *Super Metroid* communicate the
>
> game's pacing to the player. Patterns of certainty help players know
> when to unwind or prepare for big action. They also feed players'
> excitement for the game as they play or as they shut the current play
> session down; know- ing that something exciting is coming up soon will
> make players continue their current session or motivate them to come
> back to the game after shutting it down.
>
> Uncertainty
>
> While certainty describes conditions where game outcomes are
> completely known, uncertainty describes a condition where the player
> has no concept of what to expect from a game. According to Salen and
> Zimmerman, this occurs in scenarios such as someone playing a game
> with a person he or she has never met before, such as two strangers
> sitting down at a chess table in a park.46
>

> Uncertainty in level design is a symptom of poor design or environ-

> meaningless spatial configurations (as opposed to the purposeful use
> of special rooms for saving, healing, and the like discussed in the
> last section). Conversely, a junction that com- municates what each
> branch holds, even subtly, allows the player to make informed
> decisions on where to go in a level. Returning to our theoretical
> t-junction, if the player finds his or her faction's logo
> spray-painted on the left passage while the right passage contains
> stacks of crates suitable for taking cover or signs of a previous
> struggle, this creates a much more communicative space. Based on the
> recurrence of these symbols in previ- ous levels, the player may be
> able to infer that the left passage may contain resources that will
> prepare him or her for a battle in the right passage (Figure 4.26).

> FIGURE 4.26 These two sketches of a t-junction in a first-person

> path to take.

> Uncertainty, however, has its uses. In many games with experimen- tal

> Games such as Jonathan Blow's *Braid*47 or Terry Cavanagh's *Don't
> Look Back*48 feature gameplay moments where players must jump off a
> large cliff toward a bottom they cannot see. *Braid* utilizes a
> mechanic where the player can rewind time, so each jump off of the
> cliff is an opportunity to learn where obstacles are for when the
> player tries again. This allows the cliff scene of the game to be an
> iterative experience of trial and error until the player finally
> reaches the bottom.
>
> *Don't Look Back* is a modernization of the myth of Morpheus and
> Eurydice where the player must jump off a cliff to enter the
> Underworld. At the point of the game where the cliff is encountered,
> players can only move horizontally and jump. The few previous screens
> of the game at that point are also very sparsely populated with
> objects, so the player knows there is nothing for him or her to go
> back and find. With these factors in mind, the player comes to the
> realization that his or her only option is to jump off the cliff. As
> such, he or she is choosing to trust that the designer has not placed
> an instant death object below him or her. Moments like this, where the
> player must blindly trust the designer, can provide interest- ing
> moments of emotional gameplay.
>
> Risk
>
> The examples of *Braid* and *Don't Look Back* show that even in
> player- designer trust-building uses of uncertainty, there are
> opportunities to get as much information on the uncertainty as
> possible. According to Salen and Zimmerman, uncertainty where the
> player knows the nature of the uncertainty is actually risk.49 Risk is
> a somewhat modified version of uncertainty where the player has
> incomplete information on what lies beyond the point of uncertainty or
> can make inferences on what to do next based on outside information.
> Risk is potentially the most powerful of the three levels of
> information within games, as it is what makes games feel exciting.
> Risk allows players to feel that their decisions may allow them to
> come to some successful outcome. If they do not, the attempt gives
> them enough information to risk another try: fitting the
> constructivist model outlined earlier in the chapter.
>
> In game levels, the play between risk and rewarding players, often
> dis- cussed in the design of games as *risk-reward*, is of utmost
> importance in creating interesting emotional experiences. Risk is
> created by playing communicative symbols (certainty) against new and
> ambiguous chal- lenges (uncertainty), such as moving through the
> previously discussed first-person shooter hallway or a dark cave.

## SUMMARY

> This chapter has provided a useful bridge between the construction of
> gamespaces with reusable assets and the emotions of players. Designers
> can teach players about their games through different psychological
> methodologies. They can reward players for utilizing level elements in
> the proper way. They can allow players to explore levels through
> interaction and reuse their encounters in earlier levels to inform
> their later successes. They can also guide players to mastery of their
> games by allowing them to learn from previous mistakes.
>
> We have also seen that reusable art assets and architectural types can
> be used to communicate with players. These symbolic assets create
> dialogs between the design of a level and the player's interactions
> with it. Visual communication principles such as color theory,
> contrast, and others help make this process simpler, by allowing
> symbolic assets and geometries to stand out from other information.
> Finally, we have seen how these sym- bols come to embody gameplay
> through advertising methodologies or through the controlling of
> information, turning our levels into emotionally
>
> evocative memory palaces. As we move forward, scenarios like these
> will shape how we discuss players' experiences within gamespaces
> throughout the rest of the book.

> INTERVIEW WITH GREG GRIMSBY
>
> *Assistant Professor of Game Design George Mason University*
>
> Greg Grimsby is a 14-year veteran of the game industry who has worked
> on titles such as the *Dark Age of Camelot* series and *Ultima
> Forever*. He was the Art Director on *Warhammer Online: Age of
> Reckoning*, overseeing construc- tion of the game's world. He has a
> BFA in painting and drawing from James Madison University and is on
> the faculty at George Mason University, where he teaches many of the
> 3D art, modeling, and animation courses.
>
> *Can you name a game, level, or level designer (or multiples of each)
> whose work has left an impression on you? Why?*
>
> Although old school, I was always very impressed by the level design
> work of
>
> *Epic Games* in the *Unreal Tournament* series. Their deathmatch level
> designs
>
> were always executed with such a strong understanding of flow,
> landmarking, and visual impact. I learned a lot from the level design
> work in those games since deathmatch level design requires such tight
> and controlled synergy between layout and looks. The layout makes or
> breaks the play experience. Sure, players could have fun deathmatching
> in a big open pit, but that thrill wears off in about thirty seconds.
> A great deathmatch level provides oppor- tunities for players to
> master the layout of the level, to work the level to their advantage.
> A great deathmatch map is like a good story---it has important parts,
> quiet passages of exposition, and a climax. A deathmatch map has these
> same elements designed into its structure via its flow and foci. Layer
> on top of this functionality a great-looking environment with awesome
> architec- tural design and weenies and you have the makings of a great
> level.
>
> *Are there any media outside of gaming that you find inspire your
> work?*
>
> I am inspired by old master paintings of all kinds, from portraits to
> land- scapes. Their understanding of color, composition, narrative,
> symbolism, and lighting show the potential we have to understand why
> things look good and how to achieve great works of art ourselves.
>
> *Describe your level design process---how do you begin? What tools do
> you use (on or off the computer)?*

1.  **Gameplay goals.** My level design process begins with building
    familiarity with the gameplay goals and needs of the level. If a
    designer does not inti- mately know the gameplay goals of a level,
    then the process begins with learning, via design docs or
    conversations with designers, what the level needs to do from a
    gameplay functionality point of view. Then we proceed to step 2.

2.  **Theme.** I brainstorm ideas for the visual theme or environment of
    the level. Is the level an adventure in the bowels of hell? Is it a
    deathmatch in a wrecked space hulk? Is it a paintball battle in a
    low-gravity house of bounce? I try to think of a visually compelling
    and kick-ass environment.

3.  **Points of interest (POIs).** Once I know the visual theme and
    location, I sketch points of interests and brainstorm vignettes of
    awesomeness that may make their way into the level. I ask myself
    lots of questions like: Where can we tease or foreshadow? What are
    some potentially cool "money shots"? What makes the player go "this
    looks frickin' awesome"? I sketch and write down encounters and
    combat situations that could be cool.

4.  **Brainstorm and sketch flow.** Next I nail down the basic flow of
    the map. Is it linear? Does it loop back on itself? Is it a
    hub-and-spoke design?

5.  **Sketch the map.** In this step, I take all of the hodgepodge ideas
    and pull them together into a series of maps or concept roughs of
    the entire map.

6.  **Whitebox prototype.** With a map in hand, I then get into the 3D
    soft- ware and make a whitebox prototype. The goal is to get the
    basic shell in to test stuff. I test the flow, the vistas, the
    running times, and lines of sight. Are they cool? I consider where
    more landmarks are needed and

> other changes for better flow and breadcrumbing. More testing follows
> and more iterations.

7.  **Making it "purdy."** Once the layout has been validated via
    testing, it's time to make final art.

> *What is your process for playtesting your levels?*
>
> It depends upon what the playtest is trying to discover. If it's a
> gameplay test, then I get in there and test the level---walk through
> the space, battle enemies, etc. I evaluate the visual design and
> critique if the gameplay is being helped or hindered by the layout. I
> ask what can be moved, added, adjusted, or removed to bolster the
> gameplay goals. A visual playtest is looking at very different, very
> "art director-y" things.
>
> *Do you find art and atmospheric effects an important tool for
> communicating with players? Any specific examples?*
>
> There are many tools in our visual language to communicate to the
> player what we want to say. We use these tools, art and effects
> included, to convey a mood to the player and support the gameplay
> pillars. Sure, a level can func- tion on some basic level with
> whiteboxing, and it may even be entertaining depending upon the
> dependency of the game on visuals, lighting, and effects to set the
> needed mood. *Dead space* is not as scary without the lighting and all
> the atmosphere that the art and effects provide. Beyond communicating
> a mood, art can help a world feel like it has a history about it and
> make it feel lived in and believable. Architectural design, runes and
> signage, costume design, surface treatments, and color usage can
> communicate to the player who lives in your game world and what they
> are like. We used this a great deal in *Warhammer* Online to heavily
> imprint each zone with a different feel and a strong sense of which
> unique races lived in each environment.
>
> *How do you teach players to utilize your levels (without use of the
> GUI)?* The best levels have so many affordances that lead the player,
> such as path- ways, weenies, lighting, vistas, etc., that there isn't
> much to teach. Players know to follow the yellow brick road because
> we, as humans, understand certain conventions of how we interact with
> spaces. Rewarding players with cool visuals, encounters, or gameplay
> loot certainly helps incentivize them to follow your intended path
> through the level.
>
> *How do you entice players to explore game levels (without use of the
> GUI)?* Weenies work wonders to draw players' attention to a distant
> location. We can use POIs to lead the player around and utilize as
> much of our map as we want them to. Oftentimes we don't want players
> to explore every inch of a level. In the huge zones of *WAR*, a player
> certainly could go off the roads and wander over the hills and
> mountains, but there were fewer encounters out there. In essence,
> their ratio of time spent in game to experience points (XP) earned was
> very poor if you wandered and explored. Now, if your game is trying to
> entice players to explore, then you need to make it potentially more
> worth their time than grinding along your storyline. You can entice
> them with
>
> a random chance to encounter a rare mob or item. So there is basic
> carrot dangling you can do to get players to explore. The question is,
> do you want to? Can you craft the art across your *entire* game world
> to look equally cool? No. So do you want players seeing your weaker
> artistic efforts way off in the corners of your map?
>
> *If a player is lost in one of your levels, how can he find his way
> back to where he is supposed to be (without using the GUI)?*
>
> Players use their recall ring to teleport back. A hub-and-spoke design
> can certainly help along with visual clues, as can landmark weenies
> that players can see from a distance.
>
> *How do you direct the actions of players in your levels? How do you
> encour- age players to play in undirected ways?*
>
> Flow directs the action. How you funnel and channel the player with
> roads, walls, and passages dictates where they can go and what they
> do. Players will tend to follow the right-hand wall. Players will
> gravitate toward open spaces over constricted ones. The layout of the
> map, how its connected, and what you can see from each part of the
> level direct the player without hav- ing to communicate any meta-goals
> to him or her. Visual points of interest and lighting play a great
> role in focusing the player as well. We are drawn to elements that
> stand out visually---that feel more important because of their scale,
> lighting, or content. The level designer needs to maintain a hierarchy
> of importance in his or her work---subduing parts of the level that
> are not of primary importance. So there is art and design content of
> primary impor- tance, secondary importance, etc. A designer will not
> be able to lead the player to every bit of content directly, and there
> may be content available for free-range grazing, like trash mobs
> roaming a dungeon. The very existence of other paths of travel and of
> content that is not directly tied to your main storyline promotes
> undirected play, but you must be careful to control your
> signal-to-noise ratio. That is, all content competes for the players'
> time and attention---and you want players spending their time on your
> best stuff.
>
> *What "laws of level design" have you developed in your own work that
> any designer should know? What should they avoid?*

1.  Spend your art efforts where players will see it the most.

2.  Simple layouts should act as a framework for your complex visual
    designs, but underneath a yummy detailed veneer is an
    easy-to-understand flow.

3.  There should be something visually cool on screen at all times.

4.  Understand the anatomy of your environment and build that into your
    worlds. A ruleset based on real architectural structures or mother
    nature should show in your work. Forests have trees. Trees die. So
    forests have dead trees. Grass is sparse under trees where light
    doesn't reach. This is an example of a ruleset based on the anatomy
    of real forests. Your levels need to reflect this. If you are making
    up your own world, then design your own ruleset and stick to it.

5.  Get your placeholders in early, and that includes color
    placeholders. On *WAR* we created simple solid color textures and
    used cutouts from our concept art to approximate and validate our
    color palettes very early---so placeholder early.

6.  Use foreground, middle ground, the horizon, and parallaxing to
    develop rich vistas.

> Of course, there is a ton of other important stuff, but those rules
> help, especially from the artistic side of things.
>
> *As an art director, how do you address the issue of creating art for
> game worlds? Do you think of their functional game use first or their
> aesthetic elements?*
>
> Creating a world of game art means the art team must execute on the
> vision for everything that goes in it, and that is both an artistic
> act and a project management task. Even with a perfectly clear idea of
> how a game will look and what will be in it, all that artwork has to
> be built to, it must support the gameplay, and the art must meet the
> technical limitations of the engine. It is almost impossible to
> divorce the look of the game from what the capabilities of your game
> are. Similarly, if the art doesn't facilitate great gameplay, what's
> the point? This relationship requires a great deal of communication to
> hap- pen between the game development team to ensure all these are
> being met. This communication happens in preproduction when decisions
> are being made about the vision of the game, and that vision is not
> just its look, but its feel, its core gameplay, its tone, and its
> underlying design philosophy and goals. Communication and
> collaboration continue until the game is done and beyond. That is how
> you build worlds that work and look great.
>
> *Do you see environment art more as a tool for adding aesthetic value
> or as gameplay indicators?*
>
> Coming from the visual side of production, I think artists will tend
> to always be biased to a visual point of view first. It is their torch
> to bear---to protect the visual quality of the game and to make sure
> that only gameplay goals that can be executed with visual quality make
> it into the product. So environment art in the hands of an artist will
> always aim to fulfill visual goals first, just as assets in the hands
> of a game designer will fulfill gameplay needs first and visuals
> second.
>
> *In* Warhammer Online, *each quest is given out at camps as part of a
> story chapter. How are these camps designed to be hubs for multiple
> tasks within the game?*
>
> Each chapter in *WAR* is centered on a zone of the world. The writers
> and quest designers build storylines and content to match the look and
> theme of that area. They accommodate the difficulty level associated
> with that zone. They continue the plot lines that occur throughout the
> entire game. The chapter hubs are centered around visual
> landmarks---towns and war- camps usually. The artists and designers
> work together to build these chapter
>
> hubs, starting with a written document of all the quests that will
> occur there. The quests required additional, unique art, so the
> designers were given, in essence, a budget of new NPCs, props, and
> points of interest that the artists could specify to make for a hub
> and still finish the game on time. A lot of iterative design and
> playtesting ensured each hub flows well, is sized appro- priately to
> match the content there, and that the player is directed to the next
> hub as the general quest line nears completion in each area. Players
> were directed to the next hub via quests in most cases.
>
> *How does a multiplayer world like that in* Warhammer Online
> *facilitate coop- eration between players working together toward
> common goals? How does it enhance conflict?*
>
> *WAR* introduced the concept of public quests to massively multiplayer
> onlines (MMOs). Public quests are quests that players in an area can
> automatically join in on just by being at the questing area. A public
> quest, for example, may be to battle undead at an ancient ruin, and
> any characters that enter the ruin join in on the fun. This is one way
> in which *WAR* promoted coop- eration between players---to complete
> the public quest and get a chance at cool quest loot. Even in
