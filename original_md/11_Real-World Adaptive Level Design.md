> This book has investigated games and architecture as two separate
> entities that, while similar and having a lot to teach one another,
> are isolated by the boundary between game and real-world realities.
> Games find themselves apart from reality in tightly defined rule-based
> universes abstracted from the complexity of real life. And real life

> than "just games," right?
>
> There have, in fact, been games developed for the purpose of affecting
> elements of the real world by modeling scenarios in ways that let
> play- ers explore them, learn about them, or use game mechanics to
> overcome them. The term for these explorations is *persuasive games*,
> games that affect the world around them in some way. Both high- and
> low-tech game solutions have been created that add game elements to

> ways that make our everyday lives important to in-game activities and
> vice versa. These are pervasive, augmented, and alternate reality
> games that turn real-world architecture into gamespace.

> In this chapter we tear down the barrier between real and gamespace to
> discover how the rules of games can create new possibilities for real-
> world space. We consider the purpose of putting such games into
> real-life spaces, and what positive effect social games have on the
> spaces in which they are played. We also look at how models for urban
> interaction can give us insight into how these games can be designed
> to best facilitate player socialization in real space.

## WHEN MAGIC CIRCLES COLLIDE

> There exists in game design theory a concept of a separate reality
> created by games wherein the rules of a game are laws by whichh that
> the inhabit- ants, players, must abide. Entering this world requires
> only that players recognize the rules and agree to abide by them as
> long as they are inside. This concept is known as the *magic circle*,
> a term borrowed from Johan Huizinga's *Homo Ludens*3 and used to
> describe the temporary worlds created by games4 (Figure 11.1).
>
> Magic Circles Colliding through History
>
> We have previously discussed ways in which games address the world
> around them through metacommunication---the ability of games

>
> and media to highlight things about the world around them or create
> abstract simulations of real actions. We have seen this in games such
> as spin the bottle, where players play at kissing one another without
> the condition that they are in love, and online first-person shooters
> allow players to shoot one another with guns, but there is no
> real-life murder involved.
>
> For centuries, games have been used to model real-world behaviors in
> similar ways, but for uses that extend beyond the playing of games for
> entertainment purposes. In ancient China, the game Weiqi, which we
> know today as Go, was one of the four accomplishments used to qualify
> men for service in the bureaucracy, along with painting, poetry, and
> music.5 Chaturanga, which eventually evolved into what we know today
> as chess, was a simulation of Indian military strategy based on four
> divisions.6 Miniature wargaming originated in 1824 when a Prussian
> prince utilized a miniatures game created by his father to teach
> military tactics to other officers.7 In 1929, Edwin Link Jr. invented
> the Link Trainer, the first flight simulator. This device, originally
> developed as a carnival ride, would become instrumental in training
> U.S. Air Force pilots during World War II. This led the way to more
> video game-like machines with movable cameras and model landscapes.8
> In the 1960s architect and phi- losopher Buckminster Fuller created
> the *World Game*, a series of logical challenges in which groups of
> players would address world crises.9 These games are a few historic
> examples of how games have been used to cre- ate real-world effects.
> Today, the games discussed would be called serious games, since they
> model real-world scenarios in such a way that they train players to
> deal with them.
>
> Games with New Contexts
>
> Beyond serious games, there are games that utilize both high- and low-
> tech to merge their magic circles with the real world. These games do
> so by changing the context in which the games are encountered. Rather
> than engaging stationary devices like PCs or television consoles,
> these games utilize mobile devices, augmented reality displays, and
> portable pieces like playing cards to administer gameplay. This allows
> them to transform real- world spaces into gamespace. Thus the
> mechanics of these games can take on real-world contextualization.
>
> An early example, *The Beast*,10 was an advertising game created by
> Microsoft as promotional material for the film *A.I. Artificial
> Intelligence.*11 In this game, players could receive e-mails or phone
> calls, read blogs,
>
> or go to websites with information relevant to the movie's fictional
> world. This material also had relevance to actions players could take
> in the game. However, the delivery of in-game information through the
> user's real- world communication channels or regular Internet browsing
> made it contextually unique. Games like *Shadowcities*12 or
> *Ingress*,13 where users' mobile phones are the medium through which
> the game is played, require players to move through real urban spaces
> to locate and capture in-game items. During the play of either
> example, the technology is merely a tool that feeds information to
> players on how they should move through real- world gamespace.
>
> Device as Dungeon Master
>
> Such games take devices on which users would otherwise be playing
> games and make them the facilitators of players' real-world actions by
> giving them in-game contexts. *The Dark Knight ARG*,14 a game used to
> promote the Batman film *The Dark Knight*,15 sent directions to public
> game events via websites or e-mail. The computer therefore became a
> facilita- tor for game experiences. Likewise, *Ingress* challenges
> players to use their global positioning system (GPS)-enabled
> smartphones to find portals in real-world cities. These portals are
> only visible within the *Ingress* Android application, and the player
> must be close to them to interact. This requires players to use their
> phone to influence their real-world movements for the game.
>
> An important element of these games is that the medium with which the
> game is played---computer/Internet, smartphone app, text message, or
> deck of cards---is an administrator of in-game actions. Even when a
> human game master is acting from afar and sending content to players,
> the user end experience is one of interaction with his or her device.
> For this reason we can say these games have a major component of
> *device as Dungeon Master*, where real-world gameplay is facilitated
> by some technological or analog method.
>
> In modern iterations of these games, the medium for game adminis-
> tration is often portable, allowing players to move independently.
> Before smartphones were as popular as they are today, some games, such
> as Frank Lantz's *Pac-Manhattan*16---a version of *Pac-Man*17 played
> around Washington Square Park in New York City---utilized cellular
> telephones to connect players to "controllers." These administrators
> would give players game and location information that is managed by
> smartphones today. Also, cameras on these devices, portable game
> consoles like the
>
> Nintendo 3DS, and Google Glass allow for the overlaying of *augmented
> reality* (AR) information. AR is the implementation of digital
> information to enhance the real world. A simple example is the
> graphics overlaid onto televised American football games. Viewers can
> see the line of scrimmage or the line the ball needs to cross in order
> for the offensive team to earn a first down.
>
> Magic Circle Game Typology
>
> Depending on the context and delivery medium for these games, they can
> be divided into several categories. These will be useful to us later,
> as we define how these types of games can be utilized to inform game
> reuses of urban space.
>
> We can divide magic circle games into the following categories.
>
> *Pervasive Games*
>
> Pervasive games utilize a mobile device or mobile device feature of
> some sort (smartphone, text message, application, GPS, etc.) to
> administrate physical gameplay in the real world. This most often
> includes, but is not limited to, movement through real-world spaces.
>
> *Augmented Reality Games*
>
> Augmented reality games specifically utilize digital information
> overlaid onto views of the real world. This can involve finding
> objects in real spaces by viewing them through the camera of a mobile
> or other AR-capable device, or simply using the real world as a
> backdrop for a digital game (Figure 11.2).
>
> *Alternate Reality Games*
>
> Alternate reality games use delivery vectors that players use in their
> everyday lives---e-mail, phone, text message, etc.---to send players
> in-game directions or information without acknowledgment that the
> message is for a game. Examples include receiving e-mails from in-game
> characters as though you were one of their colleagues. These may or
> may not involve needing to travel around real-world space.
>
> *Low-Tech Public Games*
>
> Low-tech public games utilize a commonly agreed upon ruleset,
> scenario, or a low-tech portable game piece such as game cards to
> administer in-game actions. Examples include live-action role-playing
> (LARP) games
>

>
> FIGURE 11.2 Augmented reality games utilize mobile devices as a window
> through which players can view in-game action. This can have uses
> either in administering digital explorations of real-world space, or
> as a visual gimmick.
>
> such as historic reenactments, fantasy role-plays, and immersive
> improvi- sational theater scenarios. More game-like examples include
> *Humans vs. Zombies*,18 a "big game" played on college campuses where
> human players cooperate to fend off teams of zombie players over
> varied periods of time: hours, days, or months. There is also
> *Metagame*,19 a social card game of debating about art, culture, and
> video games for play at parties or game conferences.
>
> By understanding these types of games and how they administer real-
> world play, we can also see how they may be adapted to directly
> address real-world spaces. We can begin to see how designers may use
> them to facilitate interaction between players. In the next section,
> we will take a look at how these games can be utilized for
> architectural reuses and what the goals of such implementations are.

## ADAPTIVE GAME REUSE GOALS

> Combining games with architectural space offers opportunities for
> different types of gameplay experiences in the real world. To
> understand how these experiences occur, we must understand the goals
> of *adaptive*
>
> *game reuse*---using game mechanics to transform the experience of
> real-world spaces.
>
> Adapting Level Design Goals
>
> From Chapter 2, "Tools and Techniques for Level Design," we know that
> a major goal of level design is the augmentation of space. In adap-
> tive game reuse, space is augmented figuratively with game mechanics
> and sometimes quite literally through augmented reality devices. We
> can accomplish the other level design goals by adjusting their meaning
> for real-world contexts. "Adjusting behavior" describes how the inser-
> tion of game mechanics into real-world interactions can give actions
> gamespace-important meanings. It also describes how a player's motiva-
> tion for performing real-world actions can transform into performing
> ones dependent on in-game incentives. "Transmission of meaning" can
> describe how narrative descriptors delivered by game devices can
> change the meaning of actions ("I'm going downtown to find a portal").
> It can also describe how game mechanics in real-world space can affect
> positive change in the space, or even facilitate players toward art or
> structures that themselves have important meaning.
>
> Real-World Level Design Goals
>
> In addition to adapted versions of our goals for level design,
> real-world games can and should also have their own set of design
> goals. Unlike video games, real-world games are inserted retroactively
> into preconstructed spaces. This is the opposite of our video game
> level design methods, in which we designed game levels to complement
> game mechanics. In this instance, we are designing game mechanics to
> complement level space. This is why we concentrate on this type of
> level design as adaptive game reuse.
>
> Adaptive game reuse games are meant to highlight a condition of their
> preexisting level spaces. They may also facilitate some type of action
> within these spaces. We may even use a combination of these properties
> to affect positive change within the space. Thus we can say that there
> are three goals for adaptive game reuse. They are the building of:

1.  Games that enhance

2.  Games that pervade

3.  Games that rehabilitate

> These goals give us a lens through which we can study previously
> designed adaptive reuse games and see how they might inform our own
> designs.
>
> *Games That Enhance*
>
> The first goal for adaptive game reuse games is enhancement of the
> space that already exists. Games that accomplish this take some
> themeing or mechanics from their site and use the game to highlight
> these fea- tures. Games that enhance are great enactors of the level
> design goal of transmitting meaning. For example, a powerful tool for
> storytelling in gamespaces, as we have discussed previously, is
> embedded environmen- tal narrative---textures, 3D models, and other
> art assets with narrative purposes. Games can be utilized in
> real-world gamespace to direct play- ers toward similar meaningful
> pieces: architectural details, works of art, or museum exhibits.
>
> The Smithsonian American Art Museum utilized such a game during its
> Art of Video Games exhibit in 2012. Taking advantage of the increased
> number of visitors from the game exhibition, it had D.C.-area game
> designers create a scavenger hunt game called *Museum Quest*. Players
> would hunt down museum "ghosts," played by exhibit volunteers, and
> beat them in dice games. This facilitated movement through the
> museum's many exhibits for visitors who may have otherwise only
> visited the Art of Video Games.
>
> The Virtual Public Art Project,20 an app for displaying public vir-
> tual art, utilizes augmented reality and GPS technology to overlay 3D
> modeled sculpture onto public spaces (Figure 11.3). Augmented reality
> is also utilized on the Nintendo 3DS in the *AR Games*21 application
> to add game images to real-world environments. Players place cards
> with specific images onto a flat surface, which will be recognized by
> the app, causing game data to be displayed. For example, some games
> turn what- ever surfaces the player is aiming the camera at into a
> fishing pond or archery range. Dragons or other creatures may attack,
> causing players to move themselves around the table to avoid losing
> the game. The app also has a function for adding customized Mii
> characters to images. Creative players have reproduced the card images
> on large-scale formats to create giant Miis in real-world public
> spaces, and then spread the images over the Internet. Applications
> like this demonstrate how games or game-like applications can
> encourage participation through game incentives or creative tools.

> smartphones.
>
> *Games That Pervade*
>
> The next type of adaptive game reuse game builds upon the previous
> goal's focus of enhancing specific spatial experiences with games and
> utilizes them as tools for enhancing parts of everyday life. These
> games per- vade our ordinary experiences in such a way that they
> enliven otherwise mundane activities like commutes and turn them into
> gameplay oppor- tunities. They also facilitate social interactions
> between players of these games through shared experience of the
> mechanics and opportunities for emergent encounters.
>
> While not one specific game, but a feature of a portable console, the
> StreetPass function of the Nintendo 3DS provides a pervasive game
> experi- ence. It allows two passing 3DS devices to interact and
> exchange a small amount of data---game stats, race times, characters,
> or other things depend- ing on the games each player uses---that can
> be played within each other's games. Nintendo's own accompanying games
> for this feature require interac- tion with many other 3DS owners to
> complete, so social play is encouraged. StreetPass turns travel
> through populated areas into a game through *passive* means. While
> users do not have to be constantly engaged with it, the feature can be
> active while they go about their daily routine. This encourages users
> to keep the system with them and play with the data
>
> they receive from other players at their convenience. The mechanics of
> each game have inspired groups of users throughout the world to form
> the StreetPass Network, which arranges gatherings in cities so players
> can not only gain lots of StreetPasses but also reap the in-game
> benefits of repeat encounters. By combining features that encourage
> user interaction and repeated use in the outside world, StreetPass
> enhances players' everyday routine with passive play.
>
> Games like *Shadowcities* and *Ingress* pervade the user's everyday
> experiences. These games have players competing for territories with
> other factions. Territories are captured by attacking specific
> landmarks, which must be in the immediate vicinity of the players
> attacking them. Many of these are located at real-world destination
> landmarks, such as statues, museums, or other important structures.
> Since it is developed by a subsidiary of Google, *Ingress* integrates
> many of Google's social features, such as Google+, into its gameplay.
> This turns the game into a simultane- ous augmented-alternate reality
> pervasive game. By being dependent on location, these games can also
> become a part of a player's everyday routine or further enhance
> visiting new or faraway places.
>
> *Games That Rehabilitate*
>
> The third goal for adaptive game reuse games is spatial or personal
> reha- bilitation. These games utilize magic circle games' ability to
> both enhance an element of a space and influence the actions of
> players, and use these abilities to effect positive change.
>
> Both games and architecture have been proposed as interventions for
> various societal problems. To educate people about alternative ways to
> address world problems, Buckminster Fuller created the *World Game*.
> Likewise, architects have addressed the lack of affordable housing and
> the need for environmental sustainability with projects such as Cotney
> Croft and Peartree Way in Stevenage, Hertfortshire, England, by Bailey
> Garner LLP22 (Figure 11.4).
>
> Game designer Jane McGonigal merges the two in many of her real- world
> games, which focus on the needs of a specific location or community
> and determine how a game might be beneficial. In *Cruel 2 B Kind*, for
> example, players are texted an act of kindness that is their weapon
> and one that is their weakness but are given no information on who
> else is playing the game. They are supposed to wander around a public
> space defined as the game boundary and perform their random act of
> kindness/weapon to others without calling attention to themselves or
> indicating that they are

> playing a game. Players are eliminated if they are the recipient of
> the act of kindness which is their weakness from another player, but
> must them- selves be kind to as many people as possible to find their
> target. In her book *Reality Is Broken*, McGonigal explains that she
> designed this game to increase the *jen ratio*⎯the amount of social
> well-being in a space⎯of wherever it's played, as it reinforces kind
> behavior, even if only for the length of the game (Figure 11.5).23
>
> McGonigal's game *Tombstone Hold-Em* addresses the problem of cem-
> etery care and maintenance caused by lack of visitors through a
> variant on a popular card game. Players divide into pairs, and after
> three cards of a five-card hand are drawn, must find tombstones that
> will complete a winning poker hand. The shape of a stone determines
> what suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) it is, and the dates
> on the stone determine
>
> the card value. To use the stones as cards, the players must be able
> to touch the tombstones, but also some part of one another. A
> beneficial side effect of this game is that since players must be able
> to read stones to utilize them, they often have to clean them off or
> move debris away from them.24 In addition to these low-tech
> variations, rehabilitating games can use digital delivery vectors. Two
> games designed at George Mason University, *Onward*25 and *Life
> Quest*,26 utilize common game mechanics and themes to motivate people
> on criminal probation through that difficult process. Each app
> utilizes a check-in system to track player tasks but contextualizes
> real- world activities in different ways. *Onward* allows players to
> define their own quests, which respond to their own goals for
> bettering their lives---educa- tion, distancing themselves from
> dangerous influences, overcoming drugs, etc. As players progress
> through the quests, they are given points that can be spent in the
> game's store for items, which can then be utilized to prog- ress
> through in-game adventure levels (Figure 11.6). *Life Quest*, on the
> other hand, has players choose their own quests at the beginning of
> play, and then moves them along a board that asks them to check in on
> their quest prog- ress. For completing quests over certain intervals,
> players are given in-game
>
> rewards that can be used to customize their avatar (Figure 11.7).

## ANALYSIS FOR ADAPTIVE CORE MECHANICS

> Now that we know what the various goals for adaptive game reuse are,
> we can explore how to plan for their gameplay. We have just discussed
> how real-world games differ from video games in terms of when their
> levels are constructed. As real-world spaces, adaptive reuse games'
> levels are often built before the game that will be designed for them.
> This is counterintui- tive with how levels are designed for games⎯in
> response to the game's intended mechanics. The question is how to find
> the core mechanics of public gamespace.
>
> Site-Specific Core Mechanics
>
> Video game level design follows the mantra "form follows core mechan-
> ics." However, explorations of pervasive games by Jane McGonigal, the
> Smithsonian, Local No. 12, and others show us that like many multi-
> player games, the mechanics of these games are derived from the
> intended social experience. *Cruel 2 B Kind* encourages emergent
> pleasant interac- tions between players and visitors, *Museum Quest*
> seeks to increase user engagement in museum exhibits, and *Metagame*
> facilitates socialization at game conferences.
>
> In addition to focusing on social user experiences, these games derive
> their mechanics from the architectural use or social condition of the
> intended playspace in which they intervene. In this way, it is easy to
>
> discern the core mechanics of spaces. For example, *Museum Quest*
> seeks to expand the area of the museum that the players will explore
> and the number of artworks they will see. Thus exploration is the core
> mechanic of this game, as it is designed to support an exploration and
> observation space. As tracking systems, *Life Quest* and *Onward*
> transform the concept of a to-do list into gameplay. Depending on the
> issues players have that led them to be on probation, these games turn
> self-improvement tasks, such as signing up for a GED program or
> building a resume, into quest mechanics.
>
> Rules for Social Intervention
>
> As we have seen, many of these games are designed to facilitate user
> engagement in sites: museums, public spaces, commuter spaces, etc.
> This focus on public space allows us to revisit the urban design
> principles of Modernists and of New Urbanists to explore how the game
> mechanics of these projects build social gameplay.
>
> In many ways, the danger of "always there" technology such as mobile
> phones is their ability to connect everyone to their personal social
> network at all times. While this may seem counterintuitive to our
> discus- sions about network capabilities as facilitators of play, the
> danger of these devices is their ability to put everyone on their own
> social desert island. Self-contained mobile applications that keep
> players' attention too focused on the app itself risk becoming the
> Ville Contemporaine of the tech world. For many games, and for the
> level design concepts discussed, this is fine. However, adaptive game
> reuse games seek to create public social game experiences.
>
> We have previously discussed Jane Jacobs and her ideas on develop- ing
> neighborhoods with mixed-use buildings that allowed people to cross
> paths and interact. We also discussed how multiplayer games could
> utilize spaces appropriate for different types of play styles in one
> level to create rich, emergent spaces. This is also true for games
> meant for public spaces. On the one hand, there can be private
> gameplay stages, such as the adven- ture levels in *Onward* or the
> mini-games in the 3DS's StreetPass software, that are private to the
> owner of the device. However, these games also have a public aspect.
> *Onward* utilizes points gathered in real-world interac- tions to
> impact these private game experiences. StreetPass utilizes wire- less
> communication between devices to exchange resources required for its
> packaged games---puzzle pieces, characters, game data, etc.
> Alternating *public*-*private gameplay* encourages social gatherings
> for these games, as

> FIGURE 11.8 Games such as StreetPass facilitate movement through real
> public space by alternating public and private modes. Modes such as

> the gatherings become an important element of gameplay. If one were to
> map gameplay of these pervasive games, one might find that it
> resembles an occupant of the type of neighborhood Jane Jacobs
> advocated for: players stay primarily in their private spaces, but
> move outward to interact with others on sidewalks or in social nodes
> (Figure 11.8). In this way, the private modes of these
> games---role-playing games (RPGs), resource managing, collecting, or
> exploration---become a quest hub for the player's real ventur- ing
> into public social play scenarios.
>
> These games also benefit from the existence of *public characters*. We
> have already seen how fostering regular interaction between players
> can enhance multiplayer game experiences. Public games can benefit
> from game structures or social groups in which gameplay is facilitated
> by a leader. In this chapter we have stated that these games use the
> device as the game's Dungeon Master, but there is also room for human
> administration for organizing gameplay events, tournaments, or
> parties. For example, the StreetPass Network is administrated by Josh
> Lynsen, who began the network in Washington, D.C., after seeing
> Japanese gaming fan groups gather to use the social features of
> *Dragon Quest IX*.27 While StreetPass as an application allows for
> interaction between random players, Lynsen's organizing of like-minded
> players has fostered a much more formal move- ment of interactive
> social play. For example, players of the StreetPass game *Find Mii*,28
> an RPG where the Miis of StreetPassed players are recruited to fight
> monsters, can arrange to help one another via repeated uses of one
> another's Miis, having their Miis wear certain colors for rooms that
> require them, or exchange gameplay tips. As a side effect, this
> community has developed a shared understanding of StreetPass-enabled
> games. This is another element of constructivist learning. In addition
> to trial-and- error engagement in gameplay, constructivism includes
> the building of
>
> shared knowledge by multiple users. This is *social constructivism*,
> and can greatly enhance how people play and learn about games.

## SUMMARY

> In this chapter, we moved outward from video games and into games that
> create real-world play opportunities. We learned about the magic
> circle, a concept for describing how games create their own nested
> realities. We studied games that blur the boundaries of these magic
> circles---pervasive, augmented, alternate reality, and low-tech public
> games---and discussed the types of technology used to bring games to
> the real world. These games utilize devices as Dungeon Masters and
> allow users to move independently through the real world with game
> accompaniment.
>
> We looked beyond classifications for these games to discover gameplay
> goals that can help us bring gamespace to the real world in adaptive
> game reuse games. These games can allow us to intervene in troubled
> public spaces or communities with play. These goals for creating games
> that enhance, games that pervade, and games that rehabilitate utilize
> technol- ogy or game tools to turn users' interactions with real space
> into gameplay. If modeled properly, these games can have great
> positive effects on the public spaces in which they are played.
>
> Finally, we discovered how the structure of these games---utilizing
> mixed-use neighborhoods like those advocated by Jane Jacobs---can
> facili- tate social interaction between players. On the one hand, a
> variety of game- play mechanics and a mixture of public and private
> play modes can turn these games into self-contained quest hubs. On the
> other hand, public fig- ures such as game or social group organizers
> further help build communi- ties that can have positive effects by
> visiting public areas. Through these
>
> design methods it is possible to take what we know about level design,
> architecture, user engagement, and social urbanism and bring them into
> one shared gamespace.

> INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS WEED
>
> *Founder, Gnarwhal Studios*
>
> Chris Weed is co-founder of non-digital game company Gnarwhal Studios
> and the co-inventor of the big urban game, *Humans vs. Zombies*
> (*HvZ*). \[NB. parentheses should be roman\] Played on college
> campuses throughout the world, *HvZ* is a game of tag where zombie
> players must tag human players when they are walking through public
> areas.
>
> *Can you name a game, level, or level designer (or multiples of each)
> whose work has left an impression on you? Why?*
>
> This is the single hardest question to answer. I've grown up with
> video games. I've grown up *in* video games. I can still collect
> almost all of the heart pieces in *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the
> Past*. That information is burned into my mind. I'm confident that
> were I to suffer severe head trauma and forget my own name I would
> still be able to find those heart pieces.
>
> It's very difficult for me to make a coherent list of any reasonable
> length of level design that has left an impression on me. Now that my
> childhood house has been demolished, the levels I played on my NES and
> SNES in my room are as real to me as my actual room. Maybe they're
> more real to me, because I can never go back to my childhood room but
> I can always play through the games again.
>
> To give an actual answer that isn't a cop-out, this past week I've
> been playing *Guild Wars 2* and I have been continually impressed by
> how beautiful and varied the areas are.
>
> *Are there any media outside of gaming that you find inspire your
> work?*
>
> I think I'm very critical of myself and my abilities to the point
> where I often feel lacking for inspiration. When I do find inspiration
> it's important for me to accept it in whatever form it comes in.
> Sometimes that can be a good con- versation or a cup of coffee that
> leads you to just want to create or do some- thing. I take a lot of
> inspiration from movies and novels as well. There's also a certain
> amount of inspiration you can find in the dark parts of life and the
> things that upset you. Working to correct those things can be very
> inspiring.
>
> *Describe your level design process---how do you begin? What tools do
> you use (on or off the computer)?*
>
> For *Humans vs. Zombies* (*HvZ*) the process is very low-tech and
> almost always starts with walking through an area (or thinking about
> an area if you know it well enough), letting your mind wander to
> various thoughts of "wouldn't it be cool if ...," and then figuring
> out how to create those moments. There are a considerable amount of
> things you need to keep in mind in order to know which ideas are worth
> pursuing and how your players will interact with the space. You need
> to be better at poking holes in your designs than your play- ers will
> be. For that reason it's often helpful to work with other people and
> for one person to take on the role of saboteur.
>
> Seeing that process take shape from a single idea to an actual event
> to stories the players are telling months after the game is an
> incredible process and one of my favorite things in the world.
>
> *What is your process for playtesting your levels?*
>
> The last question describes our process of poking holes in our own
> design. That is the extent of our playtesting. Due to the nature of
> the game, we simply can't test our ideas. The best you can do is to
> learn from prior experience and try to apply those lessons to future
> designs.
>
> *Do you find art and atmospheric effects an important tool for
> communicating with players? Any specific examples?*
>
> Atmosphere is one of the most important elements of our game. With
> *HvZ* we have an unusually small amount of control over that
> atmosphere. The control we do have as designers is mainly to set the
> tone for the game. We usually make an attempt at theatrics and an
> overarching plot to tie all of the game's missions together. Though,
> truth be told, this is almost always the first area to fall victim to
> triage when we are down to the wire.
>
> The players also have a huge responsibility for the atmosphere of the
> game. The biggest challenge here is usually just making them aware of
> this. If you can make your players understand the impact their
> attitude and approach will have on their own experience, they will
> often be reasonable. There is of course a balance you need to strike,
> and there are certainly times when you need to step in and correct
> behavior. Transparency, honesty, and authority are the most important
> tools when doing this.
>
> The last factor in the atmosphere for the game is the location you are
> play- ing in and also the literal atmosphere. Weather can completely
> change how
>
> players interact with a space. Despite our best efforts, we have not
> had any luck in controlling the weather.
>
> An example of all three of these factors coming together is one of my
> favorite missions, the *Laser Mission.* The mission began at 10 p.m.,
> two hours before the game officially started and before the original
> zombie could begin tagging humans. We had players meet in our campus'
> chapel and sit in the pews. We introduced them to our plot, that they
> were among the last sur- vivors on earth living in a small community
> that was now thought to be compromised. The lights went out, zombies
> began banging on all of the win- dows. Even though they knew they
> weren't in any real danger, that the game hadn't started, the players
> all got into it. They screamed and huddled in the middle of the
> building. The zombies burst through the doors and the players
> dispatched them. They were told that in order to turn the power back
> on, they needed to fix the power grid. This involved a high-power
> laser pointer on a tripod and several Ikea mirrors. The players had to
> position the mirrors so that the beam of light would hit a spot across
> campus.
>
> We opened the doors and all walked out of the chapel into the most
> beautiful foggy night I have ever seen. Half an hour before it had
> been a clear boring night. We could not have asked for or planned for
> a more atmospheric fog. It made the mission infinitely more exciting
> and is to this day one of my favorite memories of the game.
>
> *How do you direct the actions of players in your levels? How do you
> encour- age players to play in undirected ways?*
>
> Usually there is a conceit of players needing to amass themselves in a
> spe- cific location before the mission can begin. From there we have
> several methods we use. We either give players a location they need to
> get to, a specific target, in which case the difficulty comes from
> getting to that one location, or we make the objective more vague and
> only give clues, in which case the difficulty comes from figuring out
> what or where the objective is. Alternatively, we can use a
> non-playing character (NPC) to lead the players in a specific route.
> There are pros and cons to each method mainly centered around exactly
> what the players will be able to make decisions about. Using an NPC
> and taking a specific route can allow you to lead your players in an
> interesting, well-designed route, but it removes some of their agency
> and some possibilities for meaningful choice.
>
> There is also another method, which is to create an artificial
> barrier. For example, "You can't go beyond that fence." This is much
> harder to do in a real-world game and requires that everyone playing
> keep another piece of information in their brain. This might seem like
> a small trivial detail when you're designing a mission, but in that
> moment when a player is experiencing your mission, every addition like
> this has a high cost. Making the additions intuitive and obvious goes
> a long way to softening the blow. It is important to remember that for
> every rule you add, you're adding potentially infinite edge cases that
> you haven't thought of. Without an experienced intuition for how a
> game works and how your players interact with it, this can be very
> dangerous.
>
> *What laws of level design have you developed in your own work that
> any designer should know? What should he or she avoid?*
>
> I was on a panel a few years ago with Nathalie Pozzi, whose background
> is in architecture. She explained how similar the two domains felt to
> her. In both you're creating a possibility space. You direct how
> people will interact with what you build, but there's a limit to how
> far you can control it. That has stuck with me and feels especially
> true with games like *HvZ*. When you are responsible for creating the
> very physics of your game, it is easy, I think, to take the control
> you have over that world for granted. With *HvZ* our control is much
> more withdrawn. We're forced to accept the location we're given and
> work from there. We also cannot control (no matter how much we might
> sometimes want to) how our players will interact with what we design.
> It has led to a very soft, almost improvisational approach to design.
> Rather than asking "what possibilities should I create?" I find myself
> asking "how can I prepare for the things I'm not anticipating?"
>
> Now, with screen games, and depending on your genre, that might not
> sound like a lesson that applies---and it might not apply in the same
> way. There are, however, very important collaborative moments,
> particularly in the playtesting phase. My "law" then would be to have
> a soft understanding of what your game is until you see other people
> playing it. Learn from your players.
>
> *What inspired you to create a game like* Humans vs. Zombies *on your
> college campus?*
>
> *HvZ* was a rebellious, anti-authority, extremely silly act. We wanted
> to make the campus our own. We wanted to create something fun and
> accessible. We thought zombies were cool. To say a whole lot more
> about it would probably be a betrayal. There honestly wasn't much
> thought about it.
>
> To dig a little deeper, one of my high school teachers would tell us
> stories about month-long games of capture the flag that he would play
> in college. If no one was guarding your flag, people would break into
> your dorm and steal it. I think those stories probably had the single
> biggest effect on my grades. From that moment on I knew I had to get
> into college.
>
> *How did you originally build a community of players to play a "big
> game" in a real space?*
>
> We put fliers up around campus. The start of *HvZ* also coincided with
> the beginnings of Facebook. We were really into what we were doing,
> and I think people saw that and wanted to be a part of it. Also, a
> whole lot of luck.
>
> *How does the experience of playing* Humans vs. Zombies *transform the
> spaces it is played in? How does playing* Humans vs. Zombies
> *transform player actions in these public spaces?*
>
> A low wall becomes a point of ambush. A walk to a cafeteria becomes a
> challenge of your bravery. The shadows make you feel safe. When you
> are committed to the game, it changes how you see nearly everything
> you come in contact with. It is a very primal feeling. Leaving the
> safe zones immediately
>
> raises your heart rate. Your eyes become hyper-aware of sudden
> movement. Any sound moving toward you makes you freak out. To some
> people this probably sounds like a nightmare, but for a lot of people
> they feel more alive than life usually allows.
>
> You cease to see the world around you as serving an aesthetic sense.
> The space around you is both a tool and an obstacle of your survival.
> To that end you feel much more connected to your surroundings. The
> better con- nected you are, the better you will be at the game. The
> game incentivizes that connection.
>
> The spaces change after the game is over as well. There are
> non-descript areas of campus that now hold very special meaning to a
> lot of people. While it's obviously just a silly game, the kinds of
> shared experiences it creates really can transform spaces forever. One
> example is a small courtyard on campus where nearly fifty zombies
> waited in ambush for the human players. The zom- bies had the good
> sense and the rare self-control to wait until all of the humans had
> piled into the courtyard before they sprang from the bushes and
> doorways. I don't think any humans made it out alive. From then on I
> always felt like some- one was watching me whenever I was in that
> courtyard.
>
> *What have been some positive elements of managing big games in real
> pub- lic spaces? What have been some sensitive elements you have
> needed to negotiate with people on or adapt to?*
>
> This game has led to my relationship with my girlfriend and
> friendships with some of my favorite people in the world. That is also
> one of the most com- mon things I hear about people's experience with
> games around the world. It's the reason they met their wife. It's the
> reason they met their friends. It's the reason they found a social
> group at school. Being set in a public space makes it easy for anyone
> to feel ownership over the experience and to feel an equal part in the
> experience. Setting games in a public space is a great equalizing
> tool.
>
> There is, of course, the issue of non-players. Our game can be
> disruptive. Many people's understanding of appropriate use of public
> space does not include games like *HvZ*. There is also the issue of
> the use of toys that resem- ble guns. There are many people who have a
> problem with these things. An important lesson we needed to learn was
> that our actions and our game really did have the capacity to
> negatively impact people. Our game did not exist in a vacuum. We were
> able to solve all of our issues by speaking to those people who had
> complaints and dealing with each other's issues respectfully and
> appropriately.
