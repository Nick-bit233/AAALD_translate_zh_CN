## THE PURPOSE OF REWARDS

> At first glance, the purpose of rewards in games should be obvious: to
> give players a payoff for engaging a game, achieving specific goals,
> or improv- ing their performance. However, in level design, designers
> can provide players with options of how to proceed through a
> gamespace, straight through the main action pieces or on longer paths
> of exploration, by sug- gesting the presence of rewards. Therefore, we
> may say that the purposes of rewards in level design are:
>
> Incentivizing in-game behaviors Enticing exploration
>
> Creating a sense of curiosity
>
> These three goals will form the basis of how we view rewards in this
> chapter and how we define how rewards are utilized in gamespaces.
> Before moving forward, we shall further explore these goals.
>
> Incentivizing In-Game Behaviors
>
> In Chapter 4, we explored the work of Ivan Pavlov, B.F. Skinner, and
> other behaviorists, psychologists who concerned themselves with
> observ- able behaviors in organisms. Both experiments incentivized
> actions to subjects by offering rewards.
>
> Beyond these examples---where food, comfort, and the risk of elec-
> trical shock are factors---rewards are also useful in games for
> incentiv- izing and reinforcing gameplay mechanics. We have
> highlighted this
>
> incentivizing as a method of teaching the player how to play a game by
> rewarding the correct actions that correspond to gameplay mechanics.
> However, rewards are also useful for attracting players to games and
> convincing them to spend more time in a game. As argued by Bernard
> Suits in *The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia*, games employ
> *indirect* methods toward accomplishing goals that seem inefficient
> compared to how one would accomplish the same goal outside of a game.
> He uses the examples of boxing and golf⎯if you want to make someone
> stay down for 10 seconds, you would use a force much greater than
> punches; if you want to get a ball into a cup, you would not hit it
> with a stick from hun- dreds of yards away.3 However, the boxer who
> knocks down his opponent wins the fight and moves up in ranking, and a
> successful golfer can boast about completing a hole under par---the
> standard amount of strokes it takes to complete a given hole. The
> pleasure of earning in-game rewards for these actions gives a reason
> to play despite what appear to be real- world inefficiencies.
>
> In a spatial sense, rewards are useful for making a player take risks
> or leave the game's "main path." In Chapter 5, we explored a number of
> spa- tial arrangements that humans consider dangerous: areas where
> people are open to attack, shadowed spaces, and heights. There are
> spaces that seem illogical to travel through, so-called scenic routes
> apart from a more direct route to destinations. Just as pleasurable
> scenery or a memorable landmark entice people to take alternate routes
> in the real world, extra rewards incentivize extra exploration of a
> game world.
>
> Enticing Exploration
>
> As resources, rewards have some type of scarcity or use that makes
> them valuable: enhancements to or refilling of the player's health,
> new weapons, ammunition, or an important quest item. For the level
> designer provid- ing players with opportunities for exploration within
> their gamespaces, directly alerting players to the presence of rewards
> is an effective tool. It is here where the concept of a player's sight
> lines, which have been very important throughout the book, once again
> comes into play. Rewards that are put into the player's line of sight
> (Figure 6.1) but kept out of reach can be powerful motivators to
> explore the level he or she currently inhab- its beyond any obvious
> routes. This reaction can be made stronger if the designer shows the
> reward but obscures or merely hints at the path to the reward itself.
> This can be accomplished by requiring the player to go through other
> rooms to reach the reward, placing the path behind

>
> Creating a Sense of Curiosity
>
> Curiosity is an important emotion in game development. While the con-
> cept of eliciting curiosity is similar to enticement, it is much more
> abstract. Rather than directly showing a reward to a player, the
> player gets clues that a reward may be nearby and is thus curious to
> see if the reward is indeed there. This can be accomplished with the
> use of modular assets, textures, lighting techniques, or anything that
> can be prefabricated and reused throughout a game as a symbol.
>
> As discussed in Chapter 2, "Tools and Techniques for Level Design," a
> main goal of level design is the augmentation of space with
> information. Establishing *rewarded patterns* of gamespaces or modular
> assets is one way to feed information to players as they play (Figure
> 6.2). As these patterns are demonstrated to players and rewarded, such
> as the use of the lambda symbol in *Half-Life 2*4 near friendly bases
> or weapon caches, players will know to look for further opportunities
> to be rewarded. In game structures such as the previously discussed
> problem of the protagonist, where players must hunt down
> metric-expanding rewards to progress through a game, curiosity can be
> a vital part of the game's core experience for finding both required
> and extra items.
>
> The ways in which rewards entice further engagement into a gamespace
> and reinforce game mechanics depend on the types of rewards utilized.
> We will explore several types of rewards in games and how they apply
> to spatial design in games.

## THE TYPES OF REWARDS IN GAMESPACES

> Now that we understand what rewards are for in game levels, we can
> dis- cuss the types of game rewards that can be utilized in
> gamespaces. In *Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals*, Katie Salen
> and Eric Zimmerman describe the following types of rewards:
>
> Rewards of glory: A sense of achievement gained by overcoming
> challenges in a game or winning a game. These rewards are not
> necessarily part of a game's mechanics.5
>
> Rewards of sustenance: In-game objects that allow players to maintain
> their avatar in some way: health, ammo, magic, etc.
>
> Rewards of access: An item or other gained resource that allows
> players to access a previously inaccessible area, such as a locked
> door. These are often one-time-use items such as keys. These may also
> include access to narrative items, such as video logs, or out-of-game
> infor- mation, such as concept art.
>
> Rewards of facility: A new ability for a player that expands his or
> her moveset in some way. These may or may not also allow access to new
> areas.6
>
> These rewards work within general game design to describe a game's
> effect on players and how resources can be allocated as a reward for
> over- coming obstacles. Our goals for rewards in level design describe
> a lot of
>
> these, especially rewards of facility and rewards of sustenance.
> However, these rewards are largely item based: resource recharges,
> keys, power-ups, and the like. While in level design we are concerned
> with the *placement* of these reward items in space; as discussed in
> using rewards for entice- ment, there are types of level spaces or
> experiences that can themselves be rewards. We will discuss the types
> of *reward spaces* and how they correspond to the item and mechanic
> rewards identified by Salen and Zimmerman. These spaces are:
>
> Reward vaults Rewarding vistas Meditative space Narrative stages
>
> As we will see, these spaces address issues of pacing, sight lines,
> and scripted events. By exploring what makes these spaces rewarding,
> we can understand how to create interesting levels with them.
>
> Reward Vaults
>
> The first and most obvious reward space in games is reward vaults.
> These spaces contain items, information, and other resources that
> constitute Salen and Zimmerman's gameplay reward types. They can be
> used for gameplay management opportunities such as save rooms. In
> terms of form and construction, these spaces frequently distinguish
> themselves from other level spaces in terms of lighting, music, or
> spatial character. They are often intimately sized and may feature
> high ceilings or *vaulting*, the use of arches to create a ceiling or
> roof, to architecturally celebrate the space (Figure 6.3).
>
> A prime example of reward vaults is the item rooms from the *Metroid*
> series. In the original *Metroid*,7 these rooms feature a consistent
> archi- tectural language throughout, and have their own music. This
> unique- ness reinforces the idea that the space is for a function
> apart from typical gameplay. Also, ceremonial statues with
> outstretched hands, evoking the architecture of ancient temples, hold
> reward items. Later games in the series would further embellish these
> spaces with columns, arches, and other temple forms.
>
> A less obvious example of reward vaults comes in *Bioshock Infinite*,8
>
> in which the player can find caches of items in storerooms off of the

>
> FIGURE 6.3 In many Western Christian churches, the altar is often
> located at the end of the longitudinal axis of the church and
> celebrated with a half- domed ceiling structure such as in this
> sectional sketch of the church of St. Miniato Al Monte in Florence,
> Italy (built 1062--1090). This is referred to in architectural design
> as the apse of a church. Visitors reach the church and this important
> interior space after climbing a series of staircases both outside and
> inside the building.
>
> game's main pathways. These vaults require short bouts of exploration
> and often the use of lock picks to reach. While not celebrated
> architec- tural spaces, they still contain rewards of sustenance, such
> as health, ammo, and salts; the game's mana resource; or rewards of
> access, such as audio logs.
>
> Rewarding Vistas
>
> An important but often overlooked reward in gamespaces is rewarding
> vistas, or impressive views of scenery. Like rewards of glory, these
> do not often offer anything in terms of gameplay resources. However,
> they are important for pacing purposes, providing a moment of
> catharsis after areas of high-action gameplay (Figure 6.4).
>
> Rewarding vistas attract players to linger at them by offering
> interesting or unique game art to look at: wooded valleys, sunsets,
> the energy cores of alien architecture, cities, or other "eye candy."
> Coined by designers at Valve, rewarding vistas are used heavily
> throughout both *Half-Life 2: Episode 1*9 and *Half-Life 2: Episode
> 2*.10 As these are first-person shooter games, the tendency of players
> is to run through the game to the next gunfight. However, with an
> interesting visual asset or animation to look at, players will pause
> for the intended rest. In games conducive to nearly constant action,
> like first-person shooters, rewarding vistas help create a

>
> FIGURE 6.4 Rewarding vistas provide a moment of calm after high-paced
> action gameplay.
>
> pleasantly contrasted moment of quiet gameplay without greatly slowing
> down the game's pace.
>
> Beyond pacing concerns, rewarding vistas can also be utilized to
> celebrate spatial achievements such as climbing high structures. In
> *Batman: Arkham Asylum*,11 players who explore the high structures
> out- side the asylum can view Gotham City in the distance. Likewise,
> *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past*12 rewards players for
> climbing the maze-like caves of Death Mountain by showing forests and
> clouds beyond the environment of the game itself.
>
> Meditative Space
>
> A more extreme version of the rewarding vista is the meditative space.
> Like rewarding vistas, meditative spaces offer the moments of
> low-intensity gameplay that are vital for proper game pacing.
> Meditative spaces are intimately sized and either provide
> opportunities for players to enjoy the movement metrics of their
> avatar or provide an actually meditative atmosphere.
>
> In *The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time*,13 water fountains often
> break up the game's intense combat and platforming moments. These
> spaces offer a relaxing atmosphere with soft lighting and the sound of
> water as the Prince moves around in the fountain. While also an
> example of a
>
> reward vault, as players can make the Prince drink water to heal
> himself, these spaces provide a pause in the game's otherwise intense
> action.
>
> *Portal*14 has players use elevators to travel between puzzle
> chambers. These spaces offer neither rewarding views nor resources,
> but break up gameplay so players may mentally recover from the puzzle
> they just com- pleted and prepare for the puzzle to come.
>
> Narrative Stages
>
> A reward type not addressed by Salen and Zimmerman is the reward of
> narrative *exposition*, the portion of a story that describes
> background information to viewers. As an interactive narrative medium,
> games may utilize storytelling as a reward for completing in-game
> challenges such as large battles or skill challenges. While the use of
> narrative gamespaces will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7,
> "Storytelling in Gamespace," it is important to know that games often
> utilize narrative as a form of reward. When designing levels with
> scripted narrative events, it is important to provide spaces within
> which these events occur. Like the other rewarding spaces we have
> explored, these spaces distinguish themselves from others through
> celebratory architectures such as vaulting, arches, domes, and other
> structures (Figure 6.5). Games in the *Final Fantasy* series reserve
> the most significant story elements for epic architectural set
> pieces---the tops of towers, temple interiors, and balconies. In
> earlier entries, where combat would initiate randomly as players moved
> through the environ- ment, the spaces approaching narrative stages
> would also identify them- selves through a lack of enemies. Likewise,
> many of the narrative stages in *Metal Gear Solid*15 games distinguish
> themselves with openness---high ceilings and tall monolithic
> structures for characters to speak from---in a game otherwise focused
> on alcoves and hiding places. In both examples, the lack of enemies
> allows players to leave a combat mindset, rest, and prepare to absorb
> narrative information---even if the narrative scene is
>
> followed by a significant battle.
>
> Like rewarding vistas and meditative spaces, narrative stages provide
> important pacing changes and opportunities for players to rest. These
> spaces, however, also offer the added reward of allowing players to
> learn "what happens next" in a game's story.
>
> These types of reward spaces are not made to stand alone. As exam-
> ples like the water fountains from *Prince of Persia* show us, reward
> space types can be mixed together to be both meditative and rewarding,
> pro- vide both vistas and narrative, or other combinations. Their

## MAKING REWARDS EXCITING THROUGH DENIAL

> One aspect of what makes reward spaces rewarding is that they come
> after other spaces---dangerous spaces or other transitory areas---that
> make players feel as though they earned the reward. In this way, these
> spaces enhance the effect of reward spaces through *spatial
> denial*---the act of withholding rewards from players. While the
> dangerous spaces that we previously explored provide denial, there are
> others that, when utilized, hint at rewards while keeping their true
> nature a secret from players. These denial spaces entice exploration
> by making players aware of rewards and encourage curiosity by
> providing incomplete information. In this section,
>
> we will explore several spatial orientations that architects have
> identified as useful for spatial denial.
>
> Zen Views
>
> As spatial orientations for affecting a user or player's experience
> within a space, denial is based on controlling a player's line of
> sight to or aware- ness of reward spaces. The first comes from an
> entry in Christopher Alexander's *A Pattern Language*, the *Zen view,*
> in which Alexander describes its origin:
>
> A Buddhist monk lived high in the mountains, in a small stone house.
> Far, far in the distance was the ocean, visible and beautiful from the
> mountains. But it was not visible from the monk's house itself, nor
> from the approach road to the house. However, in front of the house
> there stood a courtyard surrounded by a thick stone wall. As one came
> to the house, one passed through a gate into this court, and then
> diagonally across the court to the front door of the house. On the far
> side of the courtyard there was a slit in the wall, narrow and
> diagonal, cut through the thickness of the wall. As a person walked
> across the court, at one spot, where his position lined up with the
> slit in the wall, for an instant, he could see the ocean. And then he
> was past it once again and went into the house.16
>
> Alexander's tale of the courtyard window describes the Zen view, named
> for its origin in a Buddhist monk's house, as a deliberate and
> fleeting experience of a spatial reward experienced when traveling to
> a destination (in this case, the monk's house, as sketched in Figure
> 6.6).

> FIGURE 6.6 A sketch of the monk's house as described by Christopher
> Alexander. The window in the courtyard's stone wall controls
> occupants' view of the landscape beyond. This denial of a wide view
> makes the limited experience more rewarding.
>
> Alexander contrasts this experience to that of a house where such a
> view is celebrated with wide picture windows: when the view is
> constantly exposed and treated as a destination, it eventually loses
> its power. The monk's small window only allows the view to be
> experienced for a short while and does not treat it as a destination,
> allowing the landscape to keep its experiential power.
>
> In games, Zen views are often the first cognitive interaction that
> play- ers have with rewards or reward spaces (Figure 6.7). These types
> of views interact with different reward spaces in different ways. For
> rewarding vis- tas and narrative spaces---which, as we have seen,
> often feature architecture of epic scale---Zen views function much in
> the same way that they do in Alexander's example: offering a fleeting
> glimpse of the reward so players will strive to reach it. In the case
> of reward vaults, the player is often shown a reward---item, treasure
> chest, etc.---but the path to the reward is some- how obscured,
> leaving responsibility for reaching the reward in the hands of
> players.
>
> It should be noted that meditative spaces could be hinted at, but not
> often through Zen views. These types of spaces work best as sur-
> prises or refuges, and are often separated from the rest of a
> gamespace, rather than an element of a game's primary spatial
> sequence. Previewing these reward spaces is much more subtle, with
> entryways partially obscured by forking paths. These subtle previews
> are an impor- tant element of one of Frank Lloyd Wright's house
> designs, which we explore next.

> Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House
>
> Hanna House, located on the Stanford University campus in California,
> distinguishes itself from Wright's other designs in several ways, the
> most important being the architect's first use of a honeycomb grid for
> the build- ing's plan rather than rectangles (Figure 6.8). While a
> square or rectan- gular grid would create 90-degree-angled corners
> that are difficult to see around for occupants, Wright's design for
> Hanna House utilizes six-sided shapes with 120-degree corners. The
> effect allows occupants to partially see around the obtusely angled
> corners. This provides incomplete infor- mation of what lies beyond,
> requiring visitors to move around the corner to see a complete view of
> rooms.
>
> The human brain has a remarkable ability to process partial visual
> information and automatically complete the picture. If part of an
> image that a viewer is familiar with, such as a letter, symbol, or
> common item in a video game, is obscured, the brain will still be able
> to understand what the object is. This ability is often used by
> graphic designers to create optical illusions, such as Rubin's
> vase---the image that can be interpreted as a vase

>
> The theme of progressing through layers is common in video game
> dungeon design such as that found in many role-playing or action
> games. In *God of War*,18 player character Kratos must penetrate
> several layers of a temple to find Pandora's box. Likewise, many games

> through floors to the destination of the level. *Quests: Design,
> Theory, and History in Games and Narratives* author Jeff Howard
> highlights the theme of descent as one demarcating the progression of
> players from one goal to another. As players descend through the
> layers of a dungeon or labyrinth, they are met with both greater
> challenges and greater rewards. Howard says the layered form of
> descending spaces allow players to anticipate the rhythm of puzzle and

>
> As the previous examples demonstrate, moving through layers of denial
> space before reaching a reward can be accomplished horizontally or
> vertically. As is demonstrated by the example of Eastern garden
> design, layered denial can be created with several iterations of
> similar challenges in Montessori- style succession. For example, if a
> player must pass through three rooms to reach a reward, the first
> should feature a simple iteration of a challenge to demonstrate how
> the challenge functions, the second room should be a bit more complex,
> and the third should be the most difficult (Figure 6.11).
>
> For descent, moving through outer layers, and sequential gardens,
> these spaces work best when the player is aware that a reward is
> coming at the end of the sequence, even though the reward is often not
> shown to players beforehand. In *God of War*, it is well established
> through storytelling that an important quest item is hidden in the
> temple. Likewise, dungeons in games like *The Elder Scrolls V:
> Skyrim*20 hint at the presence of useful items with environmental
> cues: tombs and caves are littered with useful items and artifacts
> that lead to bigger rewards. Such dungeons communicate their own
> significance through environment art: banners and stone line the walls
> of tombs instead of blank rock. Such embellishments conjure
> illustrative associations with hidden items.
>
> While this type of denial space acts more as a level structure, there
> are also ways to create similar experiences with individual assets.
>
> Layered Walls
>
> As we have seen in the example of Hanna House, interiors are more
> inter- esting when occupants are aware of what else is occurring in
> other spaces. In the case of Hanna House, angles hint at but partially
> obscure what is around each corner. There are, however, other ways to
> hint at what is
>
> occurring throughout a building. One useful method that both hints at
> what occurs in other spaces and utilizes the concept of denial through
> layers is *layered walls*. Rather than creating solid barriers to
> distinguish one space from another, spaces can be divided with
> structures that allow the spaces to interact with each other:
> doorways, windows, trellises, and screens.
>
> In the mobile zombie game *Dead Man's Trail*,21 in which players must

> In many ways, *oku* is an amalgamation of all of the previously
> discussed denial spaces: it offers Zen views of other layers of the
> city through layered walls of urban fabric, features non-90-degree
> corners that goad explor- ers, and denies reward spaces with layers of
> winding passages. *Oku* also shows the power of labyrinths and
> mazes---the ability not only to be tour puzzles, but also to
> communicate with players through selective reveal- ing of information.
> In scenarios where players can view other layers of a maze, there are
> opportunities for players to gain advantages by observ- ing enemies,
> collecting information on challenges, and finding rewards, among other
> things.

> *Oku* does not have to exist solely in first- and third-person 3D
> games. In many ways, the maze from *Pac-Man*23 follows principles of
> *oku*. There are winding layers of maze with periodic rewards
> scattered throughout: power pellets and fruits. Awareness of the
> reward spaces allowed by the top-down 2D point of view motivates
> players to rush toward these rewards when necessary to escape enemies
> or gain points.

## GOALS AND REWARD SCHEDULES

> As we have seen, rewards and reward spaces of many kinds can be uti-
> lized to entice players to continue playing a game. They can be made
> more exciting to earn through the use of spatial denial that postpones
> a player's access to the reward. In many ways, the alternation between
> denial spaces and rewards is core to level design---challenges are
> designed around player metrics and rewards incentivize playing the
> challenges.
>
> When designers make players aware of upcoming rewards and motivate the
> player to reach them---through either showing the reward, describing
> it through storytelling, or other means---the reward becomes a *goal*.
> Goals are an essential component of game design. On the one hand,
> there are often narrative goals that the player achieves through
> winning a game: saving a princess, bringing peace to the galaxy,
> creating new planets, etc. Often these goals have little to do with
> the game's actual mechanics, but help flavor in-game actions in
> exciting ways. On the other hand, game- play goals like reaching a
> high score, finding an item that allows access to new areas, or
> reaching an important location can be arranged within
>
> game levels to create certain experiences. In this section, we will
> explore different aspects of game goals to discover how they motivate
> gameplay and keep players engaged for longer.
>
> Long- and Short-Term Goals
>
> Depending on their complexity and length, games typically have more
> than one goal. For example, the long-term goal of *Super Mario Bros.*
> is saving Princess Toadstool from Bowser, the evil Koopa King.
> However, there are thirty-two levels in the original *Super Mario
> Bros.* If the only mark of success in the game was whether Mario was
> saving the princess, there would be a lot of wasted gameplay and angry
> players. However, the game has other goals: eliminating enemies,
> earning power-ups, collect- ing coins and extra lives, and reaching
> the end of each individual stage. The game's mechanics are even
> conducive to players setting their own goals. During the Art of Video
> Games24 exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in
> Washington, D.C., visitors had a competition to reach level 8-1 in the
> 3 minutes of playtime allotted by the exhibit's copy of the game.
>
> *Super Mario Bros.* and many other games retain player interest
> because they have *long-term goals*, *short-term goals*, and allow
> opportunities for *player-defined goals.* These demonstrate how goals
> are *scalable* through- out a game. Long-term goals are typically
> important narrative rewards or the ends of quests. These goals provide
> a distant achievement that players must work for over time. Short-term
> goals are much more immediate: beat a stage, defeat an enemy, find a
> health power-up, etc.
>
> Many games that feature *quests*, missions during which players must
> retrieve an item or complete an action, utilize long strings of long-
> and short-term goals to move players through the game. In *Ultima IV:
> Quest of the Avatar*, players must master eight virtues by entering
> eight temples and exercising the virtues in the game's overworld.
> There are also quests for artifacts and dungeons to explore. While
> mastering the virtues and becoming the avatar are long-term goals of
> the game as a whole, mastering each individual virtue can also be a
> long-term goal based on where a player is in the game. For example,
> entering a virtue's shrine requires possessing its rune. When the
> player is retrieving a rune, that is the immediate short-term goal,
> while mastering the virtue itself is a longer-term goal that serves
> the even longer-term goal of mastering the eight virtues.
>
> The Rod of Many Parts
>
> This quest structure---finding or earning a number of items that
> facilitate the end of a game---is frequently used in games. Examples
> include *Ultima IV*'s mastering of virtues, *Super Mario Land 2*'s25
> six golden coins for unlocking Mario's castle, and activating
> elemental lighthouses in *Golden Sun*.26 Howard compares these types
> of quests to the Rod of Many Parts, a story structure in which
> characters must collect seven parts of a magi- cal artifact. Howard
> cites this structure as a mechanism for marking the progression
> through game levels and game narratives; the first piece of the rod
> may be acquired by accident in the game's narrative, but subsequent
> pieces are the result of the player progressing through further
> conflicts.27 While often used in games, this structure is also useful
> for establishing
>
> a consistent schedule of goals and rewards in game levels. One part of
> the rod (or one of the crystals, coins, maidens, etc.) is often the
> goal of one of the game's levels (dungeons, etc.). Each level is
> divided into a string of smaller challenges: puzzles, enemy
> encounters, obstacle courses, etc.
>
> Reward Schedules
>
> Doling out goals and rewards in a predictable schedule allows players
> to *anticipate* upcoming rewards. In many ways, this resembles the
> classical conditioning practiced by Ivan Pavlov---players will know
> that after defeat- ing dungeons, for example, they will receive an
> item. Goal and reward schedules are vital for holding player
> engagement in games---they keep players aware of when to expect
> payoffs for their gameplay, and therefore will motivate players to
> keep playing.
>
> The Rod of Many Parts is far from the only reward schedule used in
> games. In arcade games, players were rewarded bonuses after each
> level, and could often rely on special bonus stages to appear
> incrementally--- after two or three regular stages. If a player were
> to die halfway through the third stage, he or she would be motivated
> to feed more quarters into the arcade machine to reach the bonus.
> Similarly, modern mobile and social games offer consistent amounts of
> points or currency for finishing levels. This currency can often be
> used to purchase in-game items. This facilitates a "just one more"
> scenario in these games, with players playing to save up currency for
> desired items.
>
> In terms of level design, reward schedules are important for
> incentiviz- ing in-game behaviors, enticing exploration, and creating
> a sense of curi- osity through *consistency*. If players know that
> rewards and items come at a
>
> consistent pace, every x number of rooms in a dungeon, for example,
> they will continue playing to get the next bonus. Players may even be
> motivated to explore the room in which they expect a reward if they do
> not find it immediately accessible.
>
> This extends to symbolic art assets. If it is established that
> resources can be found by smashing crates or pots, then players will
> explore a gamespace to find these items. Rewards provide important
> motivation to explore a gamespace, and consistency in reward schedule
> helps build expectation of when to expect the next payoff.

## SUMMARY

> In this chapter, we have explored game rewards as a motivating factor
> in game levels. We have looked at the effects that game rewards have
> in game levels, incentivizing in-game behaviors, enticing exploration,
> and creating a sense of curiosity. We have also explored the types of
> rewards in both games and gamespaces, including rewarding spatial
> types that hold items, allowing the player to take a break from
> quickly paced action, and seeing more of a game's story. We have
> explored spaces that make rewards more rewarding by denying players
> immediate access to them, and how these spaces and rewards can be
> paced to create goal and reward schedules. In their own way, each of
> the topics we have covered contribute to a player's own narrative of
> how he or she experiences a game.
>
> In the next chapter, we further explore how gamespaces can be used as
> facilitators of narrative, both precreated by designers and created
> through the player's interaction with the game.
