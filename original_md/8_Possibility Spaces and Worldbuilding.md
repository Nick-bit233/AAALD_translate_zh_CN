## UNDERSTANDING IMMERSION AND PLAYER INDIVIDUALITY

> We have described games as a second-order design problem in which
> designers cannot directly control the behavior of a product's users,
> but can control the rules of a system that users interact with. The
> late film critic Roger Ebert famously cited this as a reason that he
> believed that games were not art⎯he felt that the player's ability to
> control his or her expe- rience of games diminished the designer's
> authorship.3 However, many game designers utilize this element of
> games as a way to build replayabil- ity into their products⎯the
> ability for players to have varied experiences with a game on repeated
> interactions. Many designers believe replayability and the potential
> for users to craft their own experiences in interactive worlds creates
> *immersion*, a complete acceptance of virtual game worlds as reality.
> Others, however, believe that the notion of total immersion defeats
> the promise of games as media that can be experienced by many
> different individuals. As we will see, this debate and a similar one
> within the field
>
> of architecture can give us insight into how different players use
> space and how we can create dialogs between users and a space's unique
> qualities*.*
>
> *Immersion* is a popular game industry buzzword for a game's ability
> to engage players. It is often cited as a goal of designers crafting a
> game, or as a positive quality. However, as is common with buzzwords,
> its true mean- ing is lost in its overuse. Katie Salen and Eric
> Zimmerman turn to the essay "Immersion" by François Dominic Laramee to
> readdress immersion's true meaning: "a state in which the player's
> mind forgets that it is being sub- jected to entertainment and instead
> accepts what it perceives as reality."4
>
> The Immersive Fallacy
>
> Salen and Zimmerman respond to Laramee's definition of immersion with
> the *immersive fallacy*, a statement of rejection against true
> immersion that argues that games instead deal in
> *metacommunication*---expressions that take into account their own
> state of unreality. They use anthropologist Gregory Bateson's example
> of a dog biting another in play: the bite signifies a real bite, but
> is at the same time not a real bite; it is a simulated play of bit-
> ing. Salen and Zimmerman respond with examples from the games *Spin
> the Bottle* and *Quake*. Players of *Spin the Bottle* kiss but are not
> expressing love, just as *Quake* deathmatch players are shooting one
> another but do not hate each other.5 While players may be engaged in
> these games and their dramatic elements, they are aware of the game
> within the context of the game's place- ment in the real world and
> within the scope of their own life experiences.
>
> As we have seen in our explorations of how players learn within
> gamespaces, gamespaces themselves hinge on both players' sensory
> experience of what is happening in the gamespace itself and their
> prior experience of the game they are playing or similar games they
> have pre- viously played. Many players assume upon loading a new
> first-person game that they will have the same controls as many they
> have previously experienced: the W, A, S, and D keys control player
> movement, while the mouse is moved to look around and aim. Many
> players of old Nintendo Entertainment System games were scandalized
> when they rented a game that used the B button for jump instead of the
> traditional A button.
>
> Player Personalities
>
> Moving even further away from total immersion in a game, *player per-
> sonalities* are often considered when crafting game experiences. Games
> such as *Dragon Quest III*6 or *Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar*7 ask
> players a series of questions at the beginning of the game to
> determine the stats
>
> of player characters. Numerous studies and published works have refer-
> enced player types in games. Richard Bartle famously defined the types
> *achievers*, *explorers*, *socializers*, and *killers* to describe the
> players in *mul- tiuser dungeons* (MUDs), a type of interactive space
> he helped create with Roy Trubshaw in 1978.8 The fourth edition of
> *Dungeon Master's Guide* for *Dungeons & Dragons* describes common
> "player motivations" and how players functioning as "Dungeon Master,"
> the player who designs game- play scenarios and acts as the voice of
> the game itself, can engage each of these player types.9
>
> In his Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2013 talk, "Applying the
>
> 5 Domains of Play,"10 Ubisoft creative director Jason VandenBerghe
> expanded the Bartle types to take into account five elements of
> personal- ity: *openness to experience*, *conscientiousness*,
> *extraversion*, *agreeableness*, and *neuroticism*. These were
> compared to the titular five domains of play--- *novelty*,
> *challenge*, *stimulation*, *harmony*, and *threat*---to determine
> where players fit on a chart of the first four domains (threat is left
> out and applied to its own set of criteria), each divided into four
> quadrants (Figure 8.1). As players answer where they fit on each
> quadrant of the chart, they can visu- alize their player personality
> on a 4 × 4 grid diagram. VandenBerghe pro- poses that the test be used
> as a method for applying "accurate empathy" to a designer's gameplay,
> allowing him or her to think like different kinds of

>
> The suggestion that player personalities factor greatly into the type
> of character one might build in a game, or that the types of games
> people play are dependent on their personalities, weighs heavily
> against the idea of total immersion in games. While the ideas of
> Bateson, Bartle, and VandenBerghe factor greatly into the subject
> matter of games themselves, they say little of how users engage
> gamespace. Architects have been strug- gling with notions of total
> spatial immersion versus metacommunication. It is this struggle that
> will help us explore how the spirit of individual gamespaces can be
> used in concert with player individuality.

## ARCHITECTURAL PHENOMENOLOGY AND PLAY

> In Chapter 3, "Basic Gamespaces," we discussed the concept of *genius
> loci*, or "spirit of place." This element of architectural design
> challenges design- ers to give places their own individual character
> or transmit meaning through unique spatial experiences. While
> originally referring to a town's guardian spirit in Roman culture, the
> term gained its current usage by those applying the philosophy of
> *phenomenology* to architecture.
>
> Architectural phenomenology was greatly inspired by the works of
> German philosopher Martin Heidegger, whose application of phenom-
> enology argued against understanding the world in scientific or
> objective abstracts, but rather in empirical terms based on one's
> sensory informa- tion at any given moment.11 Architect Christian
> Norberg-Schultz applied Heidegger's thinking to architectural space,
> arguing that spaces should be understood for their own elements rather
> than through the lens of previ- ous experience.12 As such,
> practitioners of architectural phenomenology are often concerned with
> creating spaces with a strong experiential element or that maximize
> some element of the building's site while shutting out exterior
> influences or symbols. Architect Peter Zumthor, a noted
> phenomenologist, stated that he begins projects by thinking which
> emotions or experiences he wishes to convey, while staying true to
> elements of site and material.13 For one piece, the St. Benedict's
> Chapel in Sumvitg, Graubunden, Switzerland (Figure 8.2), he emphasized
> the wood used to create the building by pur- posely adding a creaking
> floorboard. Zumthor described this addition as one that would "exist
> just below your level of consciousness."14
>
> Phenomenology's supporters argue that works such as those by Zumthor
> are to be enjoyed for their own sake, without influence from

>
> a priori knowledge (knowledge known inherently without sensory input).
> Immersion seems to be the phenomenology of play: enjoying a game
> without input from the outside world. Some people take the concept of
> role-play to heart when playing, enacting what they would not in
> real-life situations, such as being an evil warlord, fighting powerful
> foes, or playing a member of the opposite sex. On the other hand,
> Salen and Zimmerman's immersive fallacy points to even this kind of
> play as engaging the meta- elements of games.
>
> The phenomenology of gamespace is a mix of self-contained elements
> that also engage in meta-dialogs with players and culture. On the one
> hand, we have thus far explored how games utilize symbolic assets to
> modify player behavior or communicate with players and other cultural
> elements outside the game itself. On the other hand, level design
> seeks to emphasize the unique mechanics of games, as phenomenologist
> archi- tects seek to emphasize the building's unique materials and
> experience. Therefore the same elements that work to emphasize the
> unique parts of the game they are in---modular assets used for
> behavior modification, asset arrangements for communication,
> etc.---can also engage meta-elements of games. Game world architecture
> can help facilitate player interaction, but it can create surprising
> game events by providing resources for different types of players.
>
> In this sense, gamespace rejects architectural phenomenology.
> Gamespaces can be encountered by many different people in many differ-
> ent ways. The way that two players interact with a level, even if they
> share player personalities, will be completely different unless the
> developer forces players to play in a specific way. While such games
> better address concerns over authorship of gameplay experiences in
> games by taking *choice* away from players, they often are not
> remembered very fondly or do not have gameplay longevity---*replay
> value*.
>
> Even games that are ultimately linear, such as those in the *Final
> Fantasy*15 series, offer players some choices: character
> customization, job selection, side quests, etc. When these choices are
> stripped away, leaving less choice in gameplay, the response is not as
> warm. This was the case with *Final Fantasy XIII.*16 In terms of level
> and world design, the game was much more linear than some considered
> acceptable, described by some reviewers as a "long hallway."17 Modern
> first-person shooter level design has likewise been criticized for
> being a string of cutscenes and high-action encounters linked by
> hallways (Figure 8.3). While these spaces may suc- ceed at maximizing
> a game's mechanics, they leave little ability for players to create
> their own experience of the game to compare with others' own
> experiences. In this way, we must seek to have a simultaneously
> phenom- enological and metacommunicative approach to level design.
>
> In the next section we further explore the elements of gamespace that
> allow players of different types to have their own experiences with
> gamespace and how gamespaces use their phenomenological elements to
> create emergent experiences.

## EMERGENT SPACES

> Throughout the book, we have discussed games as *systems*. In *Rules
> of Play*, Salen and Zimmerman address the *complexity* of systems
> through the lens of Jeremy Campbell, author of *Grammatical Man*.18
> Campbell describes complexity in systems as a "special property in its
> own right" and "enabling them to do things and be things we might not
> have expected."19 Since we often understand games as systems, that is,
> as sets of objects with behaviors and attributes that interact within
> a space,20 we can say that they have the potential to be complex and
> do the unex- pected things that Campbell describes. If we consider the
> human players and their wildly divergent personalities as part of the
> interactive systems of games and space, these systems become
> increasingly complex. This complexity leads to an element of system
> that Salen and Zimmerman describe as "crucial" for understanding how
> systems become meaningful for players21: *emergence*.
>
> Emergence
>
> In the previous chapter, we discussed how users interacting with games
> cre- ate *emergent narratives*, stories created by how one plays a
> game. As a con- cept, emergence refers to unexpected outcomes of
> systems in which unique components interact with one another. One of
> the most famous examples of emergence in the field of computer science
> is *The Game of Life*, a cellu- lar automation created by John Conway
> in 1970. Conway's *Game of Life* is a "zero-player game," in which a
> user places a single cell on a large virtual checkerboard and
> activates the simulation. Rules dictate how living cells interact with
> dead cells around them, and how the living cells create more living
> cells. As the simulation runs, geometric patterns emerge due to the
> rules of the simulation. Some are temporary, while others actually
> create new cellular bodies (Figure 8.4). While the emergent outcomes
> of the system are observable when the simulation is playing, they
> cannot be learned from simply reading the rules of how cells interact.
> Thus these emergent results are dependent on the interactions of
> objects within the rules of the simulation.22 Rules and interaction
> are what make emergent outcomes *possible* within systems such as
> architecture and games. In Chapter 7's example of the Hagia Sophia in
> Istanbul, Turkey, cultural and geographic factors led to the church
> being an important status symbol for conquering armies in the area.
> Such factors exist outside the structural systems of the building
> itself (which in the case of Hagia Sophia has created emergent
> narrative of its own: the central dome has collapsed twice), but are
> no less part of

> their own emergent narratives as they play; two players' stories of
> how they heroically vanquished the same monster are often very
> different. Through their rules and design, gamespaces offer players
> *possibilities* in how they can play, which we discuss next.
>
> Possibility Spaces
>
> We have explored the idea of gamespace as emergent worlds from a
> theoret- ical perspective, through player personalities,
> phenomenology, and emer- gence itself. The question is how to create
> worlds appropriate for emergent behavior through the largely
> phenomenological mindset we have used thus far throughout the book:
> emphasizing a game's rules and expressive elements through modular
> symbolic assets. Warren Spector, a designer whose credits include
> *Deus Ex*, *System Shock*, and *Wing Commander*, was once quoted as
> saying that games create *possibility spaces*. Possibility spaces
> "provide compelling problems within an overarching narrative, afford
> creative opportunities for dealing with these problems, and then
> respond to player choices with meaningful consequences."23
>
> The idea that games are spaces where players can address problems
> through creative solutions is useful for defining how we must think of
> game worlds as emergent spaces. As illustrated by Conway's *Game of
> Life*, predefined rules or pieces with programmed behaviors can have
> unpredict- able results. However, that illustration and those like it
> demonstrate emer- gence through barely interactive computer
> simulations. Possibility spaces still address this emergent element of
> predefined elements of games, but do so in such a way that brings the
> player into the fold. In Chapter 7,
>
> "Storytelling in Gamespace," we discussed gamespaces that provide
> resources for emergent narrative and the example of *Half-Life 2*24
> playtest- ers killing barnacles by rolling exploding barrels at them.
> This action could take place because developers created procedures
> that allowed these things to happen, placed them in an environment
> that invited exploration, and allowed players to play. Likewise,
> players of the original *Team Fortress*25 discovered that they could
> jump very high with the soldier class if they jumped into the air and
> shot one of his rockets downward. This trick, called the rocket jump,
> became so commonplace in *Team Fortress* gameplay that it was featured
> in Valve's trailer for *Team Fortress 2*,26 where soldiers fly through
> the air to synchronized swimming music.
>
> Setting the rules for worlds then allowing players to explore their
> pos- sibilities is a powerful tool for in-game worldbuilding.
> Worldbuilding through possibility space encourages the creation of
> interactive elements that can be given narrative context with art,
> writing, and other expres- sive methods. This creates a world that is
> not only narratively expressive in the way Tolkien's Middle Earth was,
> but also interactively expressive in ways that only interactive
> designed spaces can be. In the next section, we discuss the actual
> construction of such worlds and how one designer introduces players to
> them.

## MINIATURE GARDEN AESTHETIC

> In *Spore Creature Creator* designer Chaim Gingold's thesis,
> "Miniature Gardens and Magic Crayons: Games, Spaces, and Worlds,"27 he
> inter- prets an often mentioned but never explained aesthetic of
> legend- ary designer Shigeru Miyamoto, the *miniature garden.*
> According to Gingold, Miyamoto's miniature gardens reflect the design
> principles of Japanese gardens: miniaturized worlds in which occupants
> can explore a "multiplicity of landscapes"28 within a short period of
> time. Examples include the land of Hyrule in the *Zelda* series
> (Figure 8.5), the various environments in *Super Mario* games, and the
> explorable alien planets in *Pikmin*.29 He describes these worlds as
> complete and self-contained, citing three elements that make them both
> manageable and believable for players:
>
> Clear boundaries Overviews
>
> Consistent abstraction30

> FIGURE 8.5 The map of Hyrule from *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the
> Past* has within it a variety of environments for players to explore
> that are quickly acces- sible, have clear limits, and are abstracted
> by their construction with symbolic game assets.
>
> The construction of Miyamoto's worlds, and how they are introduced to
> players, factors heavily into their success. As possibility spaces,
> they have a limited and clear set of rules and objects that the player
> can inter- act with in the world. For ease of both a designer's
> construction and the players' ability to understand them (not to
> mention memory limitations of games), these gamespaces are constructed
> with modular symbolic assets rather than custom-built. This makes the
> world and its possibilities easy for players to understand: assets and
> their variations create a rich system of communication that players
> come to know as representational of game- play mechanics. Likewise,
> keeping this world contained to clear boundar- ies and a limited set
> of assets also allows players to learn and interact with the symbolic
> system more effectively (Figure 8.6). It is the player's freedom to
> interact with these symbols, however, that produces the possibility of
> gameplay emergence.

> While Miyamoto's miniature gardens provide opportunities for player

> Overviews
>
> The first method of introducing possibility space in miniature gardens
> is through overviews. As stated by Gingold, "Miniature Gardens are
> scale models of bigger phenomena. Fish tanks and gardens are scale
> represen- tations of systems bigger than people."31 The miniature
> nature of game worlds has not gone unnoticed by writers throughout the
> history of the medium. In 1983, David Sudnow published *Pilgrim in the
> Microworld*, a "stream of conciousness"32 retelling of his experiences
> with the Atari 2600 game *Breakout.*33 Sudnow, over the course of
> several months, feverishly practiced the game until achieving mastery
> of it. Throughout the book are increasingly complex diagrams of the
> gameplay mechanics, especially the physics of how the ball and paddle
> interact with one another.34
>
> *Breakout*, as with many early video games, has a single-screen
> structure that conveys a simple overview of the game action. In the
> first screen from *Super Mario Bros.*,35 the player can see a variety
> of important symbols from the game, as well as an enemy and a power-up
> item. This provides an introduction to many of the rules of *Super
> Mario Bros.*'s possibility space that are repeated through subsequent
> screens and levels.

>
> games from the 1970s and 1980s, the metaphor of a fish tank is an apt
> one: players interact with the game world from a perspective of
> omnipotence--- they can see more than what the game character could
> conceivably see. This point of view works well in point-and-click
> adventures such as *The Secret of Monkey Island*,36 where players must
> find objects on detailed story screens---any given puzzle can
> typically be solved with what is visible (Figure 8.7).
>
> Top-down games such as *The Legend of Zelda* and *Dragon Quest* share
> this same ability to great effect: designers are not limited to the
> character's point of view when showing or hinting at secrets beyond
> their current geo- graphic location. From a miniature garden
> perspective, this also affords the ability to give players an overview
> of game possibilities. In many ways, we can attract players with new
> possibilities in the same way we do with rewards: by showing something
> previously unseen in a place that the player must explore to find.
>
> *Overviews in 3D*
>
> Three-dimensional games such as first- and third-person games in which
> the player is viewing the game from very close to or from their avatar
> present their own challenges for integrating overviews. Some games
> provide a cutscene that flies over the level prior to the beginning of
> game- play. In some cases this can be convenient, showing players what
> they will
>
> encounter or even allowing players to find where they should go on a
> specific mission in a game world that allows lots of otherwise free
> explora- tion. However, these can feel artificial and break the sense
> that the player is in a space where he or she can be surprised or make
> discoveries.
>
> The work of Chinese architect I.M. Pei provides insight into how
> three- dimensional space can have the overviews common in older video
> games. In buildings such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
> Cleveland, Ohio, Pei uses a glass wall as the façade to show viewers
> outside what is contained within. Upon entering the building, the
> museum exhibits are revealed on a series of stacked floors arranged
> like a collector's shelves (Figure 8.8). The building provides a
> summary of its contents with this reveal, but rewards those who
> explore further with more information.
>
> Pei's design for the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in
> Washington, D.C., alerts visitors to their options for exploration
> when they walk into the large atrium (Figure 8.9). Angular balconies
> and walk- ways protrude into the space from floors above, offering
> glimpses of the exhibits contained within, but requiring visitors to
> explore to receive the full experience. Like the Rock and Roll Hall of
> Fame, the overview gives a summary of what is contained within each
> section of the building but denies full understanding of each exhibit
> unless the visitor penetrates further into the space.

>
> As Pei's architecture shows us, overviews can be accomplished with
> first- or third-person views through the creation of vistas. These
> vistas allow players in games to see out over the game world and
> discover the limits of its possibility space. This is another scenario
> in which height in level design can be beneficial, allowing players to
> get an overview of 3D game worlds. In games such as *Dragon Quest
> VIII: Journey of the Cursed King*,37 players can often gaze out from
> the top of cliffs to the world below, seeing distant landmarks. Many
> worlds in *Super Mario 64*38 also feature a high point from which
> players may look out onto the environment, seeing red coins, item
> boxes, enemies, obstacles, and other gameplay elements. Such vistas go
> beyond rewards, tactics, or scenery, and can give players an
> impression of the possibility spaces of 3D worlds. Combined with
> Lynchian elements such as landmarks, boundaries, and recognizable dis-
> tricts, players can make informed decisions about the path they will
> take through a space, just as a visitor to the Rock and Roll Hall of
> Fame can plan which exhibits they would like to see first.
>
> While view-based overviews are great ways to convey the possibility
> spaces of games, they can also be a passive experience. When used too
> often, they can make the pacing of games feel stagnant. However,
> Gingold also highlights another form of overview that better utilizes
> games' interactivity.
>
> Tours
>
> Another method for introducing possibility spaces to players in
> miniature gardens is the *tour*. A tour is an initial introduction to
> gamespaces and their mechanics through a linear level experience.
> These tours often also show players game mechanics or elements that
> they may revisit at another time, teasing gameplay to come.39 In the
> example of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the architecture of the
> space requires visitors to enter a linear exhibit on the history of
> rock music after seeing the lobby over- view but before actually
> getting the opportunity to explore the previewed exhibits. Such a tour
> gives the teased exhibits a sense of historical context and offers the
> ability to explore them freely as a *reward of facility*, a reward
> that offers new abilities.

> Possibility Space and Procedural Literacy
>
> By now, it should be clear that a primary concern of miniature gardens
> is allowing players to maximize their possibilities by giving them a
> thorough understanding of what can be done in the space. In this
> chapter, we have thus far explored how space can be constructed to
> introduce what is possi- ble within gamespaces. The introduction of
> game mechanics in possibility spaces aids the development of what
> designer Ian Bogost calls *procedural literacy*.42 Procedural literacy
> is a familiarity with the rules of a game and how they function within
> an established possibility space. Symbolic assets are an element of
> this: players learn that certain level surfaces are solid while others
> may cause damage. They may learn the identity of items, gates, puzzle
> elements, objects that can weigh others down, etc. In terms of pure
> mechanics, this can also translate into an understanding of met- rics,
> character abilities, or when players may encounter obstacles in games.
> These assets are the building blocks of levels, but are also the
> procedural language of gamespaces.
>
> Bogost highlights the communicative power of such cause-and-effect
> procedures, arguing that developing procedural literacy in players can
> not only allow them to be better players of a certain game, but also
> help in the creation of *procedural rhetoric*---using game rules as a
> system of communication. Game rules and the construction of gamespaces
> as
>
> a system of communication between the designer and player are a
> central theme of this book: designers must create a dialog with their
> players to make the best play experience possible. Procedural rhetoric
> is a tool that many persuasive games, such as those designed by Bogost
> or Jane McGonigal to solve real-world problems through gameplay,
> utilize.
>
> Developing both procedural literacy and rhetoric helps players under-
> stand gamespaces and their possibilities better. In the previous
> examples of *Super Mario 64* and *A Link to the Past*, players are
> guided through the mechanics that they will use throughout the entire
> game during tour lev- els. They are also given overviews that allow
> them to see other gamespaces where these mechanics will be useful.
>
> Building procedural literacy and then exhausting player possibilities
> can create powerful game experiences. A previous example utilized
> Terry Cavanaugh's *Don't Look Back*43 to discuss uncertainty---the
> feeling of hav- ing no information of how to address game
> scenarios---and how it may help subvert game design standards. The
> example of a cliff that the player must jump off of blindly also helps
> demonstrate how designers can use exhausted game possibilities to
> guide players through the next steps of a game. Players who reach this
> cliff know that they have completed every- thing there is to do in
> each previous screen, and so know that their only option is to leap
> off the cliff (Figure 8.11). Tomorrow Corporation's *Little Inferno*44
> creates a biting satire of free-to-play online and mobile games by
> restricting players to a very limited set of mechanics: buying and
> burning objects. Despite colorful descriptions of the many uses of
> each "buyable" (the game does not allow players to buy things with
> real money) item, the only thing players can do with them is burn
> them. This limited possibility space and establishing of procedural
> literacy allow the game to lampoon the trivial nature of in-game
> objects that people buy for real money in free-to-play games.

## JAPANESE GARDEN DESIGN AND WORLDBUILDING

> According to Gingold's interpretation, Miyamoto's miniature garden
> aesthetic borrows heavily from the design traditions of Japanese gar-
> dens. This is especially true when observing Japanese garden design's
> use of boundaries and abstraction. In *Secret Teachings in the Art of
> Japanese Gardens*,46 David Slawson explores the purpose of Japanese
> gardens. In the West, he observes, many Japanese gardens utilize ver-
> nacular Japanese architecture: pagodas, *torii* gates, lanterns, etc.,
> to give the garden "a Disneyland quality."47 However, the true purpose
> of such gardens is to give the impression of natural landscapes in a
> small, explorable area. Depending on the scale one wishes to convey,
> these landscapes are created through the use of various landscaping
> features meant to represent natural formations: rocks may be placed as
> moun- tains, cliffs, or land forms; raked gravel may be used to
> represent bodies of water, as may small ponds (Figure 8.12).
> Vegetation also varies based on the scale of the garden; moss may be
> used as trees if the garden shows something very far away, or as grass
> if the garden represents something closer. Small pines are also used
> to create forest-like areas. Such gardens transport viewers to
> landscapes outside of their immediate surround- ings within quick
> overviews and tours.

> FIGURE 8.12 A turtle rock, formed from a rock with moss in the middle
> of a small pond, represents an island in the middle of a vast ocean.
> Such formations demonstrate how landscaping creates simulated
> landscapes within Japanese gardens.
>
> In video games, Miyamoto's Mushroom World and Hyrule are primary
> examples of this. In early *Legend of Zelda* games, players move
> through Hyrule in a largely non-linear fashion and may visit a variety
> of different landscape types: deserts, lakes, forests, mountains, and
> oth- ers within the boundaries of the game world. *Super Mario Bros.*
> games feature tours of differing landscapes as each in-game world
> utilizes a dif- ferent theme: grass, desert, tropics, ice, etc. *New
> Super Mario Bros. U*48 for the Wii U even utilizes the likeness of
> traditional Chinese scholars' stones⎯naturally formed stones with
> asymmetrical forms and perfora- tions (Figure 8.13) that are popular
> features in Chinese gardens⎯as a backdrop for its mountain-themed
> world. Some of these worlds are largely interactive, such as Hyrule,
> and others are simply overviews of interactive spaces, such as those
> in *Super Mario Bros.* games. This allows us to explore how Japanese
> gardens treat points of view and what they can tell us about game
> worlds.
>
> Points of View in Japanese Gardens
>
> In his book, Slawson addresses two types of Japanese gardens⎯those
> viewed from fixed vantage points in a building or structure and those
> that the user can interact with (Figure 8.14). As with camera angles
> in games, each type offers its own advantages and disadvantages when
> dis- cussing how one sees the miniature world of the garden. The
> vantage point gardens allow viewers to see exotic landscapes from
> outside, giving an overview of everything within. Like 2D top-down or

> viewpoint-based enticement strategies in their designs. The Hyrule of
> *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*,51 for example, utilizes
> landmarks in a Kevin Lynch-esque fashion to entice players toward
> narrative- important quests.
>
> Most importantly, the work of Slawson and his predecessors of over a
> thousand years gives insight into how game designers may use
> artificial landscapes and controlled user interaction to create
> possibility spaces that
>
> feel like expansive game worlds. Slawson specifically utilizes two
> schemas that are of great importance to level designers, *scenic
> effects* and *sensory effects*, which we will briefly explore to
> understand how Japanese gardens can help us build emergent game
> worlds.
>
> Scenic Effects
>
> Slawson's first schema of Japanese garden design is scenic effects:
> the abil- ity to create visual representations of memorable
> landscapes. Historically, Slawson writes, such an element of garden
> design was important to Japanese aristocrats who traveled to China and
> Korea during the T'ang Dynasty,52 as it allowed them to re-create
> sights they had seen in their travels. This, he claims, leads to a
> *feature-oriented* design aesthetic, where certain features are
> re-created to evoke feelings that one has when viewing them in
> nature.53
>
> Designers therefore often seek to develop scenic effects in such a way
> that reflect how something would happen in nature. Slawson uses the
> example of a knarled tree:
>
> A gnarled pine from the mountains (or a similar one from the nursery)
> serves in the garden not merely as a weathered tree but also, by
> virtue of the way it is planted in a composition of rocks, as a
> powerful agent for evoking the atmosphere of craggy mountains far from
> civilization.54
>
> Creating landscapes in accordance with how they occur in nature helps
> give landscapes their individual character, or *yo*. The rocks,
> plants, water, and earth elements used by designers become a symbolic
> language through which the Japanese garden designer speaks to viewers
> about what type of landscape he or she is creating.
>
> Such ideas are important in creating the feeling of possibility space
> worlds as representations of a landscape and for giving them their own
> genius loci. When creating game worlds as illustrative landscapes,
> design- ers can arrange art assets in a way that reflects the
> environmental sto- rytelling methods. These, however, can establish
> the narrative reality of the game world. A world with a properly
> defined sense of place is a world that players can learn to use. As we
> have seen, consistent symbolic assets help create a rich system of
> communication between designer and player. Putting boundaries on this
> system in a miniature garden helps define the possibilities of a
> gamespace.
>
> Gingold argues that clear boundaries help miniature gardens be
> "intelligible and plastic,"55 or understandable and moldable. A game
> with a clearly defined set of possibilities is easy for someone to
> pick up and play. *Minecraft*56 is an excellent example of such a
> world: clearly defined block objects form the world's geometry and
> have clearly defined relation- ships with one another. From these
> relationships, many potential combi- nations of materials are
> possible. Online players have created everything from giant 8-bit
> sprites to re-creations of famous real-world and game architecture.
>
> While such elements create visually appealing landscapes in gardens
> and possibility spaces, they can also be used for creating interesting
> spatial experiences. Slawson covers this in his next schema.
>
> Sensory Effects
>
> Slawson's description of sensory effects in Japanese gardens reflects
> the ideas that drive much of this book. He discusses the use of scenic
> elements as a medium for directing the experience of viewers. He also
> suggests directing visitors through gardens with hearing-based
> stimuli, like the sound of running water, or with the kinesthetic
> sensations of touch and movement through spaces. It is in his
> discussions of garden formations, however, that the lines between
> Japanese gardens and Gingold's miniature garden possibility spaces
> begin to blur.
>
> As we have seen, carefully defining the boundaries of possibility
> space helps us teach players how to engage our games. Slawson uses the
> term *scroll* garden to describe what he and we have been discussing
> as vantage point gardens, likening the experience of early Japanese
> gardens to unroll- ing a scroll and viewing it from above. Such
> gardens, he states, must fit within a single frame, and he likens them
> to composing shots on film.57 In the possibility spaces of games, both
> 2D and 3D, the way in which a designer frames a view can have great
> impact on how a player understands what he or she is supposed to do.
>
> This emphasis on scene composition addresses a problem that many new
> designers have when designing miniature garden spaces, exterior
> environments, and large game worlds: perceived randomness. In nature,
> trees, rocks, cliffs, and other natural features place themselves over
> time in unplanned ways. New designers often haphazardly place trees,
> rocks, and even buildings randomly on their maps, unaware of the
> importance of their positioning. Directing toward carefully placed
> scenic assets is how we help players understand our worlds.

> FIGURE 8.16 Scenery in miniature garden worlds directs player views
> across horizontal and vertical planes.
>
> As we saw in our earlier explorations of overviews and tours, many 3D
> miniature gardens direct the gaze of their players with carefully cho-
> sen high points from which the world can be viewed. When composing
> such views, it is important to understand how to direct the player's
> eye throughout your scene. Slawson describes the use of the two
> *visual planes*, horizontal and vertical, for this purpose, and
> recommends engaging both (Figure 8.16). He describes vertical,
> horizontal, and *diagonal* forces of objects in a garden, which
> dictate the direction in which a feature's energy flows and therefore
> its ability to point views in a certain direction. In terms of these
> planes, we have already seen how textural elements on the ground of a
> game world can direct the player's eye, such as with stripes of
> shadows leading into doorways in *Half-Life 2*. Diagonal forces,
> represent- ing the visual forces of man in Japanese gardens, can
> direct views both upward and forward from a player's point of view.
> Diagonal elements like landscaping features or fallen debris can both
> frame and be visual launch pads to important landmarks. These
> landmarks are typically vertical ele- ments such as tall buildings,
> mountains, and others, useful for directing user attention58 (Figure
> 8.17).
>
> It is the relationship between landmarks and the less obvious elements
> of a view that can truly cement our ability to direct players through
> game worlds. The orientations of the most noticeable elements and the
> less noticeable elements are of equal importance to these designers.
> For exam- ple, gardens often feature rocks laid out in *horizontal
> triad* (Figure 8.18) and *Buddhist triad* (Figure 8.19) formations.
> Horizontal triad rocks are laid in such a way that each formation
> points to one another, while the formations themselves imply stability
> through triangular form. These formations emphasize horizontal motion.

> to reach a gateway to the next area, often situated in a vertically

## OFFERING EXPERIENTIAL CHOICE

> Gameplay emergence can be a product of both phenomenological elements,
> such as symbolic assets that are unique to certain games, and the
> uniqueness that each player brings to all games. We have learned how
> miniature gardens, spaces that introduce players to their gameplay
> possibilities and offer the abil- ity to explore multiple landscapes
> while directing player attention to impor- tant features, enable such
> emergence. Now we will look at spatial orientations that help us
> develop an awareness of player choice and discuss gamespace types that
> offer directed choice to players within explorable worlds.
>
> Introducing Choice
>
> When starting *Minecraft*, players awaken on an island with no
> resources and must find shelter before night falls and enemies appear.
> At this early stage, players may only move, jump, and punch, but may
> punch anything they wish. Upon punching blocks in the environment,
> they learn that the blocks break apart, can be collected, and can
> subsequently be placed
>
> elsewhere in the world. Given the short time limit the player has to
> gather resources on this first day, successful players will seek
> easy-to-gather resources and make their shelter from them, often a
> simple hut or hole. However, the next days will see players expanding
> their resource pool and crafting tools. These tools allow the
> gathering of more powerful resources and eventually, the crafting of
> better tools. Eventually, the game opens up and the goal is less one
> of surviving nightly raids and becomes user defined: users can create
> what they want in *Minecraft*'s sandbox world.
>
> In many ways, the single-player experience of Mojang's *Minecraft* has
> much in common with I.M. Pei's architecture. Like the Rock and Roll
> Hall of Fame, the experience of *Minecraft* begins as one of linear
> discovery and becomes one of freedom within a defined world. Both
> works show how one introduces the element of choice in many games by
> initially guiding players through the rules in a directed or limited
> manner and then allowing play- ers to explore on their own. In
> *Minecraft*, this process introduces players to the game's symbolic
> system of blocks. Each has uses and may be combined with other objects
> and is described by consistent artwork. However, this process also
> involves the player's a priori knowledge: gathering wood has certain
> connotations in human society, as does crafting a sword or pick- axe.
> The owner of a new pickaxe is likely to seek rock to use it on. This
> play between linearity and freedom, as well as unique and prior
> knowledge, helps direct players through the game. In this way,
> introductions into the symbols that enable player choice both are
> phenomenological and involve metacommunication. Players are introduced
> to unique symbols that they can interact with but that invite
> association with familiar objects.
>
> Beyond the visual symbols themselves, that they were introduced in a
> limited fashion has much to tell us about the boundaries of miniature
> garden worlds such as *Minecraft* and how we introduce large systems
> of choice to players.
>
> Intelligible Choice
>
> To acclimatize players to its large system of possibilities,
> *Minecraft* models choice by giving limited options to players in the
> beginning, but slowly expands it as players learn new things. At the
> beginning of the game, play- ers are limited by what resources they
> can quickly gather, and thus the areas they have access to are
> limited. As they create new tools and learn more about the world,
> players gain access to more parts of their island, more resources, and
> get the impression that their own possibility space is expanding.
>
> *Minecraft* and other sandbox games, such as *Grand Theft Auto IV*62
> or the previously discussed *Little Inferno*, carefully limit player
> choice at first and slowly reveal new possibilities as players master
> each part of the game. These miniature garden spaces take Gingold's
> idea of establishing clear boundaries and use it as a teaching method:
> imposing limited boundaries at the beginning and expanding them as
> players learn the game. If these games gave players access to their
> entire possibility spaces at the begin- ning, it would be too big, too
> unintelligible. Framing portions of the world and possibility space
> into districts helps players master a few commands, and then move on
> to new ones when they are ready for boundaries to be pushed aside.
>
> Lyndon and Moore discuss architectural boundaries and breaking them in
> *Chambers for a Memory Palace.*63 Humans place boundaries to organize
> space and mark territory. As Lynch points out, many of these
> territories have their own individual character that sets them apart
> from others. Lyndon and Moore go on to explore Japanese design
> elements such as *shoji*, rice paper screens that slide to reveal the
> outdoors, and the lack of interior furniture on *tatami* mat floors,
> which suggests continuous inte- rior space. The edges of individual
> mats work much in the same way that horizontal shadows do, drawing the
> user's eye across the horizontal plane of the floor and into the
> outdoors, which are revealed by an open *shoji* (Figure 8.21). In game
> design terms, a player of a game is like the per- son inside the
> *tatami* matted room: he or she must perform the actions one would
> inside, and can then have the *shoji* pulled aside to reveal the next
> part of the environment. The relationship between districts should be
> established, as the *tatami*'s horizontal lines draw the eye to the
> outside, both to transition to the next district and as an act of
> denial when the

>
> Shaping Choice, Risk, and Reward
>
> The border between these distinct districts---outdoors and
> indoors---gives occupants a choice of whether to remain indoors and
> view from within, or to explore the newly revealed environment.
> Outdoors may offer more pos- sibilities for movement than the previous
> confines of the indoor space. Such is true of sandbox environments:
> players in *Grand Theft Auto IV* initially take on missions within a
> limited area of Liberty City, but are introduced to new districts as
> the game progresses. As they master the choices available to them in
> one district, new districts and new choices open up (Figure 8.22).
>
> When developing such environments, designers can treat the borders
> between districts as skill gates that remain closed until the player

> FIGURE 8.22 *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s districts each contain a set
> amount of tasks to perform before a new one is opened up. This forces

>
> for the Super Nintendo addresses this dynamic in an amusingly
> self-aware way, having police characters barricade the paths from town
> to town, claiming that it is their "claim to fame." These barricades
> are not removed until the player completes the main quests in each
> town or powers himself or herself up to appropriate levels to survive
> the next area of the game. Once each barricade is overcome, the world
> becomes openly explorable. In sandbox worlds, this often means that
> the player has agency to test all of the world's limits: *Grand Theft

> *Minecraft* players can build their own structures, etc.

> Behavioral biologist Karen Pryor calls this process of slowly
> introduc- ing new information on a set of actions *shaping*. Shaping,
> she argues, takes the components of a complex action and breaks them
> into steps that can be individually mastered and built on. Her process
> of shaping behaviors focuses on increasing the criteria for positive
> feedback as new actions are learned: a reward is given first for
> something simple and then for increas- ingly complex steps. She argues
> for each action to be taught one at a time in isolation. She likens
> this method to learning a golf swing: players first learn how to grip
> the club, and then learn successive parts of the action. Rewards are
> given at first for mastering the grip, then for having a proper grip
> and backswing, then for properly moving from grip and backswing
> through to proper weight shifting, and so on. Lessons are kept
> interesting by keeping tasks "ahead of the subject"---always teaching
> the next action as each is learned rather than resting on already
> mastered ones.65
>
> Shaping choice in the way that miniature garden games do allows play-
> ers to understand the certain, uncertain, and risky elements of
> worlds. By understanding the choices available to them, players are
> able to interpret the best path to take when given a choice---elements
> they are familiar with lead them on paths where they can take educated
> risks or engage in actions they are certain they can perform. However,
> such gamespaces can subvert these choices by offering little
> indication of what is down multiple pathways. In the case of

> one screen (Figure 8.23) without indica- tors as to what the correct
> passage is to reach the end. In these cases where the game has shaped
> players' understanding of its possibility space, players are actually
> motivated to explore all of these passages in case one could contain
> extra treasures, despite the possibility that they could be attacked.

> Reward-Possibility Mazes
>
> Throughout the book, we have discussed games in the *Metroid* series
> and their unique style of gamespace popularly dubbed
> *Metroidvania*---so named for their use in the *Metroid* and
> *Castlevania* series. These spaces are mazes, as discussed in Chapter
> 3, tour puzzles with multiple branch- ing pathways and dead ends. They
> are also miniature garden-like in that they have distinct districts
> and boundaries that offer players the opportu- nity to explore
> multiple environment types. Finally, they employ the shap- ing and
> expanding possibility spaces of sandbox worlds: players begin in
> confined areas with a limited amount of abilities and gain access to
> new areas as they learn new moves (Figure 8.24).
>
> In addition to Metroidvania, we might call such worlds
> *reward-possibility mazes*, as movement through them is facilitated

> rewards. Levels in these games greatly employ denial methods to goad
> players into exploration. Players who explore such mazes are rewarded
> with power- ups, such as expanded jumping capabilities, better armor,
> or new weapons that allow access to new areas.
>
> The reliance on rewards for advancement makes finding them criti- cal
> to moving through the game. As such, these games often employ the
> risk-reward uncertainty described in the previous section's
> *Earthbound* example: showing multiple passages without specifying
> which one is cor- rect. We may call these *uncertainty nodes*. Lyndon
> and Moore describe such a node in Eliel Saarinen's Cranbrook Academy
> of Art. At the end of an important axis on the grounds, Saarinen
> placed a portico that opens to a pond on the north side, the Cranbrook
> Art Museum to the east, and the Cranbrook Academy of Art Library to
> the west (Figure 8.25). This portico, as the climax of the axis,
> offers a choice of spaces rather than one dis- tinct one. Each path
> likewise offers its own rich opportunities for explora- tion rather
> than a singular space.66

> the Speed Booster are an example of these kinds of symbols. *Batman:

## DEGENERATIVE DESIGN

> We have described how designers can build possibility spaces by
> clearly defining and communicating the rules of game worlds to
> players, and then letting them have rein to explore them. Such spaces
> may offer plenty of opportunity for players to stay occupied with
> possibility space worlds. However, as we saw in the previous chapter,
> hidden surprises beyond the boundaries of established gamespaces can
> offer an incredible sense of dis- covery for players that would
> otherwise be testing the limits of your game worlds without reward.
>
> Throughout this and other chapters, we have discussed ways to encour-
> age players to explore our games: enticing with denial, rewards,
> uncer- tainty nodes, etc. Shigeru Miyamoto's quote from *Game Over:
> Press Start to Continue* that prefaced Chapter 6 applies here: "What
> if something appears that should not, according to our game rules,
> exist?"69 Such is the purpose of *degenerative design*, design that
> breaks the established rules of a game and gamespace.
>
> Salen and Zimmerman use the term *degenerate strategies* to describe
> what is commonly known as *cheating*: utilizing hacks and loopholes in
> game rules to gain an advantage. In some ways, these can break the
> real- ity of the game world, allowing players to move outside its
> boundaries or uncover the world's artificiality. These may also gain
> these players an unfair advantage over players who are playing by the
> rules, which can ruin the experience of playing games.70 Degenerate
> strategies, however, also allow opportunities for creative strategies
> within the rules of a game--- rocket jumping in *Team Fortress*,
> barnacle bowling in *Half-Life 2*, and bomb jumping in
> *Metroid*---that become beloved parts of their games.
>
> Gingold references degenerative design when he discusses the con- cept
> of *hide-and-reveal*, the revelation of new spaces when players test
> the boundaries of miniature gardens. He uses the work of Miyamoto as
> an example, emphasizing his ability to "tease, goad, and lure" players
> into finding unforeseen areas in his worlds.71
>
> *Super Mario Bros.* is a notable example of hide and reveal, as its
> place in the history of games and the comparison of its spaces and
> those of its contemporaries reveal the power of its own degenerative
> design. *Super Mario Bros.* was one of the first games to feature
> horizontally scrolling levels that were unique to one another: many
> players had not seen such gamespaces before. In this way, the ability
> to scroll left to right already broke many previous gameplay
> boundaries. However, players who ducked on pipes could find
> underground passages. Players who jumped in certain spots or at
> certain blocks that appeared to be plain brick were likewise rewarded
> with secret treasures or beanstalks into secret cloud worlds. In
> *Super Mario Bros.*, Miyamoto established that the screen scrolled
> left to right, that question blocks held items and that brick blocks
> did not, and then completely threw these rules out the window to
> surprise and delight players. Once these were a part of the understood
> logic of *Mario* games, new logic was offered in subsequent titles,
> such as the white blocks players could duck behind and shortcuts under
> quicksand found in *Super Mario Bros. 3.* When designers establish
> rules, they should also be open to the idea of breaking them in ways
> that do not break the logic of the game, but instead provide exciting
> discoveries for players.

## SUMMARY

> In this chapter we have discussed the assumptions of game players,
> writers, and spatial designers regarding how designed spaces respond
> to the world around them. We have learned how the design elements
> described in
>
> other chapters support the idea of games as self-contained immersive
> systems, but how their reliance on players make them systems for
> metacommunication. We have studied how these competing relationships
> offer the opportunity for distinct play styles and unique occurrences
> that result from the rules of games, known as emergence. Emergent
> elements of games highlight how games are not simply containers for
> linear stories, but also spaces that offer interactive possibilities
> to players.
>
> These spaces of possibility are enhanced by visualizing the space as
> miniature garden worlds that contain myriad environments for players
> to explore. Visualizing these spaces as miniature gardens in the
> Japanese tradition gives us guidelines on how to introduce possibility
> to players: overviews, tours, and defined but ever-expanding
> boundaries. Japanese garden design also informs the way we direct
> players through these spaces: through the careful design and placement
> of landscape features and level geometry that highlights and
> emphasizes places of interest.
>
> Such miniature garden worlds and possibility spaces benefit from the
> designer limiting player interaction until they are ready to learn
> more about the world's possibilities. We explored this idea as
> shaping, teaching by slowly introducing the elements of possibility
> within a space. Worlds that teach through direction but also entice
> exploration through uncer- tainty form reward-possibility mazes, which
> reinforce exploration through rewards and shaping through denied
> access to new areas until rewards are earned. These spaces also
> encourage risk taking, as they present players with multiple, equally
> enticing paths.
>
> Finally, we learned how despite the discussion of setting up,
> teaching, and creating possibility through rules, designers should
> embrace oppor- tunities to also break their own rules. These expand
> the possibility spaces of games in ways often delightful to players,
> and reward those who test the limits of game worlds.
>
> In Chapter 9, we explore multiplayer interaction through urban design
> principles for mixed-use neighborhoods.
