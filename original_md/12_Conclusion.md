# Conclusion

> As our industry moves forward in developing a critical framework from
> which to understand game design, we must not leave other vital
> elements of game development, such as level design, behind. We must
> learn to balance game design's own *firmitas*, *utilitias*, and
> *venustas*---functional requirements, usability, and delight---rather
> than ignore one to focus on another.
>
> We have explored many facets of both architecture and games here. We
>began with a historical foundation of both arts and discovered ways in
> which each dealt with technical and societal factors to create
> meaningful experiences. This led us to explore methods for analyzing
> spatial design and documenting this analysis through plan, section,
> elevation, and other representational methods. We explored tools and
> techniques for designing game levels based in traditional game design
> methods, as well as some that merge architectural foci on modularity
> and measurements.
> 
> These tools in hand, we studied traditional spatial types in games and
>how they might be organized like traditional architectural forms. We
> dis- covered how the size of spaces and the ways in which they are
> arranged can influence our experience of them. From some of these
> practical concerns, we explored spatial design to see how it can fit
> our goals of level design: the adjustment of behavior, transmission of
> meaning, and augmentation of space. For this we discovered that
> gamespaces can utilize art assets to which we can assign game
> behaviors or associations, making them sym- bolic art assets. With
> these we can teach players how to play our games. We also saw how
> simple manipulations of the way spaces are arranged and presented can
> create emotional experiences such as suspense, fear, denial, and
> reward. And, we saw how we may establish rhythms of goals in our level
> spaces that entice players through our games. We also dis- cussed how
> many of our art assets can help mark the player's place in a story.
> This is especially true of textures and materials in environment art, which can be powerful descriptors for working with traditional
> narra- tive structures such as the hero's journey.
> 
>After illustrating some of these experiential orientations of space,
> we explored ways in which we may tell stories or provide players with
>the resources to make their own. As many games create possibility
> spaces through a set of rules embodied in an environment, we
>discovered how games build worlds through rules. We returned to our
> spatial learning methods to discover how these possibility spaces
> slowly shape user behavior through controlled exposure to a game's
>mechanics that later allow players to freely explore. Such
> explorations of mechanics formed our discussions of multiplayer
> gamespaces, and how theories of urban- ism demonstrate how we might
> create exciting multiuser worlds through mixed-use spatial layouts
> rather than by separating gameplay functions. To complement these
> discussions of how gameplay is controlled, we further explored rhythms
> in games---both in architectural spaces and in sound assets. Through
> this, we discovered how sound and rhythm might be of use for
> establishing the mood of our game, as well as for directing the pacing
> of gameplay. In Chapter 11, we explored games that utilize gamespaces
> both in the computer and out of doors, or that utilize digi- tal
> components to influence real-world game actions. These games can be
> used for entertainment purposes or may have real-world impacts as
> inter- vention pieces.
> 
> In many ways, Chapter 11 highlights the place that the level design
> knowledge in this book holds in the developers' toolbox. These ideas
> are beyond technology. While they influence how we build levels when
> we sit down at our 2D art or 3D content creation programs, middleware
> game engines, or proprietary software, they have a larger meaning. The
> advan- tage of learning spatial design principles for level design
> from an art form as timeless as architecture is that the principles we
>utilize today will be relevant when our current favorite game engines
> are historic footnotes. Many of the most influential works cited in
> this text are at least fifty years old. Many are hundreds or even
> thousands of years old, yet the experi- ences they create through
> their spatial arrangements have withstood both time and the emergent
> narratives brought on by intense human interac- tion. Through these
> timeless spatial design principles, we hope to build timeless
> gameplay.
