## THE ROLE OF RHYTHM IN GAMES AND BUILDINGS

> An essential part of our discussions about game pacing and
> architecture has been *rhythm*, the timed repetition of elements or
> movements. In gameplay, this has meant a steady alternation of high
> and low moments of gameplay, of dangerous and safe spaces, or of
> challenges and rewards (Figure 10.1). Each of these elements puts
> players on a schedule, which is internalized, providing powerful
> enticement through gamespace. In architecture, rhythmic use of visual
> elements---structure, shadows, etc.---provides a visual draw through
> space. Rhythmic elements also imply spatial separation, turning a
> single space into several (Figure 10.2).
>
> Rhythm is also an essential element of music and sound design. In
> Western musical notation, rhythm is a function of the number and type
> of notes found in a bar of music. Musical *meter*, often describing

> the number of patterns and their timing in a piece of music, is
> another vital element, as it involves the study of specific repeated
> elements. Justin London, a musical scholar, has said that meter,
> understood as rhythmic elements repeated over the course of a piece,
> initially introduces itself to listeners and then forms a schedule on
> which it is expected.3
>
> In these ways, the rhythmic elements of games, architecture, and music
> are not at all unalike. Rhythm not only provides the structure (pacing
> of games, spacing of columns, repetition of beats) that holds these
> media together, but also cognitive responses in consumers. In this
> sec- tion we explore several ways in which rhythmic elements can
> affect our understanding of gamespaces.
>
> Mood and Music
>
> When discussing sound in games and how it affects player mood and
> action, the first portion of a game's *soundscape*⎯the sounds in a
> game that form a sonic environment⎯that most people would think about
> is the game's music. Indeed, music in games is one of the most often
> noted and remembered elements of the experience. Jack Wall, composer
> for *Mass Effect* and co-founder of Video Games Live, a traveling
> video game music concert, said, "Music is the unseen character. It's
> the emotion behind the actions of a player. It's gently there to show
> the game designer's intentions. It's totally collaborative with the
> developer."4 As the Hip Tanaka quote above describes, game music
> contributes greatly to worldbuilding in video games. While players are
> interacting with mechanics, narrative, and other elements of the game
> world, they are not in the space themselves. Music offers emotional
> cues to players, and good composition can steer player emotions as
> deftly as gamespace construction can.
>
> In a 1998 study, researchers at the Institute of HeartMath and the
> U.S. Naval Postgraduate School tested the ability of certain types of
> music to
>
> affect the mood of listeners.5 They chose four types of music:
> classical, new age, grunge rock, and the then-recently created genre
> of designer music--- music designed for affecting listeners in
> specific ways. The designer music is specifically of interest, as it
> most closely resembled contemporary video game music, with quick beats
> and atmospheric instrumentation. Using a 45-item questionnaire, the
> researchers tested how the four genres affected these elements of
> mood: caring, mental clarity, relaxation, vigor, hostility, fatigue,
> sadness, and tension.6
>
> The results supported the hypothesis that all four types of music
> would affect listeners' emotional states. Classical music was noted to
> have no significant emotional effects other than lowering tension. New
> age music yielded increases in relaxation and decreases in hostility
> and tension, but also lowered mental clarity and vigor. Grunge rock
> produced increases in hostility, fatigue, sadness, and tension, while
> decreasing caring, relax- ation, mental clarity, and vigor. Finally,
> the designer music increased caring, relaxation, mental clarity, and
> vigor while decreasing hostility, fatigue, sadness, and tension.7
>
> Studies like this underscore music's ability to reach out to listeners
> and pull them into the emotion of a piece of gameplay. As we have
> seen, games are allowed to take us to places typically avoided by
> other media---fear, tension, aggression, and others---for the sake of
> creating an imaginary interactive experience. Game developers will
> often use sophisticated lighting or art to create this tension, as we
> see in many survival horror games. However, music can be the factor
> that truly cements the atmo- sphere hinted at by visual assets. Music
> may also be the factor that creates an atmosphere in scenarios where
> sophisticated visuals are not an option. *Metroid II: The Return of
> Samus*8 for the original black-and-white9 Game Boy is a great example
> of how music can be used as a tool to build a tense atmosphere even in
> the absence of sophisticated graphics. In this game, players must
> explore the catacombs of a distant planet to hunt Metroids, the
> titular parasitic aliens featured in the series. Lacking color or
> high-resolution graphics, the developers still strove to encapsulate
> the isolated mood of the original through other means. Visually,
> designers changed the silhouette of Samus as she gained abilities
> rather than her color, as had been done in the first game. Samus's
> sprite was also enlarged to show more detail. This had the side effect
> of turning much of the game
>
> levels into narrow spaces (Figure 10.3).
>
> In many ways, the musical composition for the game enhances the feel-
> ing of narrow space in *Metroid II*. Of his score for the original

> FIGURE 10.3 *Metroid II* utilizes both visual assets and a creative
> soundscape to recreate the isolated feeling of the original *Metroid*
> on the NES. Samus's sprite is bigger, causing many of the levels to
> become narrow spaces. The musical compo- sition enhances the cramped
> feeling of the game levels by evoking the feeling of being in a nest.
>
> Tanaka said that he wanted to create music that blurred the lines
> between the game's music and the sound effects of the game's world.10
> Ryoji Yoshitomi's score for *Metroid II* takes this idea further by
> having extremely minimalistic music throughout the game. The music is
> often more like rhythmic ambient sound, with electronic cave sounds
> and the noises of creatures as the instruments. The music switches to
> a driving riff when players encounter Metroids. This adds to the
> tension of fighting a large, powerful enemy in a narrow space. Adding
> to the actual music is the Metroid's screech whenever players shoot it
> with a missile. This is especially notable, as the distance of the
> Metroid from Samus facilitates how fast the rhythm of screeches
> occurs. When there is a short lull in the player's firing, the Metroid
> can inch closer, and the rhythm of screeches increases---further
> heightening the scene's tension and the player's aware- ness of the
> game action.
>
> Musical composition does not need to be a separate field from sound
> design. In his composition for *Dead Man's Trail*,11 composer Akash
> Thakkar created musical tracks based on his own *Foley* work, the
> recording of everyday ambient sounds. For one track, Thakkar created
> sound effects of slamming doors, shooting the last shell in a shotgun,
> and dragging a
>
> cello bow over various household objects.12 These sounds reflect
> popular tropes of zombie apocalypse stories: distant battles with
> hordes, losing the last bit of one's ammunition, the sounds of
> movement inside buildings. All these things add to the tension of each
> level, and make players aware of the actions they must take to
> survive.
>
> The musical compositions of *Flower*,13 on the other hand, are simple
> guitar and piano arrangements designed to elicit feelings of
> relaxation and happiness. The player sound effect of the game⎯a
> constantly blow- ing breeze⎯adds an element of nature to the music.
> Gameplay sounds are musical⎯as players hit flowers to open them, piano
> and violin notes play, adding to the simple background music. As
> players gain power and speed, so do the notes being played.
>
> Jim Guthrie's soundtrack to *Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP*14
> underscores the game's point-and-click mechanics and sense of mystery.
> The music of the game matches the emotions of gameplay: driving and
> rhythmic when the player explores new territory, slow and discreet
> during puzzles, or epic and assertive during boss battles. The
> creators of the game promote it as a "progressive rock album you can
> hang out in"15---the game is as much a progression of musical pieces
> as it is a progression of gameplay, giving the experience a rock
> operatic feel.
>
> As the Institute of HeartMath and the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School's
> study of mood and music above shows, designed music like that found in
> games can have a promotional benefit on the listener's positive emo-
> tions. Fast-paced songs increase mental clarity, while smoother ones
> aid in relaxation or concentration. Music with oppressive riffs and a
> slow tempo, like much of the grunge music used in the study, has
> negative effects on the emotional state of listeners. In this way,
> game music should seek to build a consistent emotion, and level
> designers should seek to accompany their scenes with music that best
> conveys the mood they wish to create. Upbeat level one music from a
> platformer would go poorly with the dark spaces of a survival horror
> game.
>
> The discussion of music and mood in games brings up another poten-
> tial avenue for music in game levels: becoming interactive.
> Understanding the concept of interactive game rhythm will have great
> impact on how we understand the player's relationship with the rhythms
> of gamespace.
>
> Rhythm and Interactive Sound
>
> Game music often blurs the lines between sound effects and music. Some
> games, such as *Metroid II* and *Dead Man's Trail*, utilize sound
> effects in their
>
> music to create a hybrid soundscape-song. Others, like *Flower* and
> *Sword & Sworcery*, utilize musical sound effects so that players feel
> as though they are contributing to both the game's outcome and music
> by interacting with the game. Describing this phenomenon of
> interactive music, interactive audio researcher Karen Collins has
> called game music *multimodal*---involv- ing more than one sense.
> Collins argues that games engage three sensory modalities at once:
> audio, visual, and haptic (interactivity/action oriented).16 Following
> the mechanics of "call-and-response" toys such as Simon,17 where
> players attempted to repeat a pattern of electronic lights and tones
> by pressing buttons, a new type of game was popularized in the
> mid-1990s that had players responding to button prompts so a track of
> music would play---the rhythm game. *PaRappa the Rapper* for the Sony
> Playstation was one of the first games in this style, requiring
> players to press a specific sequence of buttons in time with a musical
> track. If players failed to press the proper buttons, the track would
> play incorrectly. In this way, the player
>
> had agency on how the background music of the game played.
>
> *Rez*,18 by United Game Artists, took a different approach. Rather
> than having players respond to musical prompts to maintain proper
> sound, *Rez* is a third-person rail shooter where game sound is
> musical. As players shoot enemies in levels, the music flourishes and
> different colors permeate the gamespace, building it from a blank grid
> to an array of complex archi- tectural forms (Figure 10.4). The
> simultaneity of player action and the development of both game sound
> and visuals has been described as *synes- thesia*, where a person
> experiences multiple sensory experiences from one sensory input.19 A
> *synesthete*, a person who experiences synesthesia, might perceive
> letters or numbers as inherently colored.
>
> This type of gameplay, where user input and action affect game assets,
> produces a unique experience for players. Games in the *Bit.Trip*
> series,

> game.
>
> such as *Bit.Trip Beat*20 and *Bit.Trip Runner*,21 have an effect
> similar to that of *Rez*. Players move forward consistently through
> levels and must respond to musical input in different ways depending
> on the mechanics of the game. *Beat* involves moving a paddle to hit
> dots à la *Pong* (Figure 10.5), and *Runner* is a "constant
> runner"-style game where players must make their character jump and
> duck to avoid obstacles. The timing of levels, kept consistent since
> the game automatically propels players forward, cor- responds to the
> timing of a musical track (Figure 10.6). Likewise, interac- tion with
> specific bullet types (in the case of *Beat*) or mechanics (in the
> case of *Runner*) occurs when the player is supposed to hear those
> sounds. As the player plays, he or she comes to expect these sounds in
> each track and will move to make them happen. Over time, the player
> wonders if he or she is playing the game or if the game is playing him
> or her.
>
> In terms of design, these gamespaces use level geometry as a medium
> for activating specific musical sounds: *Rez* and *Bit.Trip* players
> are both adding to and responding to the music of gamespaces by
> playing the game, yet at times players may feel that since they are
> anticipating specific rhythms, they know what move to make next in the
> game.

> Rhythmic Entrainment in Games and Spaces
>
> As we have discussed here and in other chapters, patterns and repeated
> instances of game sounds, objects, or gameplay experiences can train
> players to expect events to occur or understand what strategies to
> take. In this way, we can say that entire games or game worlds can
> have rhythms, much as game music can. Our exploration of rhythmic
> synesthesia games like *Rez* and *Bit.Trip* shows us that players
> interacting with rhythms will learn to anticipate when specific
> movements will occur. This rhythmic synchronization can also occur on
> a larger scale with game rhythms and with elements of gamespace.
>
> In biomusicology, there is a concept known as *entrainment*, where an
> organism syncs itself to an external rhythm or to other organisms.22 A
> form of entrainment was used to facilitate the enticement practiced by
> early arcade games: if players are aware that bonuses occur every two
> levels, they will pay extra money to continue after dying. Entrainment
> patterns are very common in reward and short- and long-term
> goal-centric games like the *Zelda* series. Players know that after a
> short number of tasks in the overworld of many games, they will enter
> a dungeon, which will often contain a new weapon and an important
> quest item. The rhythm of *Zelda* gameplay drives players onward and
> is often enhanced by other elements that highlight this rhythm. For
> example, the embedded narrative events surrounding each dungeon often
> follow a dramatic arc. Players learn why they should go into a
> specific dungeon; they enter, there is a climactic battle, and finally
> falling action as players reap their rewards and order is restored.
> The games' status screens often reveal how many quest-important items
> there are to collect, and therefore how many dungeons. Such games give
> an overview of their rhythmic system and train players how to
> recognize it.
>
> In purely spatial terms, buildings and game levels can also utilize
> rhythm. An example of this is the Great Mosque of Cordoba. On the one
> hand, it utilizes the shaded lighting condition that was established
> as having great ability to entice users through space due to its
> creation of atmospheric ambiguity. On the other hand, it has rhythmic
> arcades and double arches with alternating red and white voussoirs
> also entice through physical form by reaching in all directions
> through the hall. Architecturally, rhythmic components like the
> columns in the Great Mosque, staircases, shadows, doorways, terraces,
> or others create a sense of motion and continuity. These draw users
> through a space in the same way that linear elements, like those seen
> in Gothic churches or in *Half-Life 2*,23 do.

>
> The spacing of rhythmic elements in architecture can affect how users
> move through a space. In department store and mall design, for exam-
> ple, floor tiles are commonly smaller near expensive items. This makes
> shoppers slow down as their carts begin clicking on tiles faster,
> creating the feeling that they are moving too fast.24 Floor tiles
> between stores in shopping malls are often very large, so users will
> entrain their steps with the wider pattern. When shoppers reach the
> front of a store, the tiles at the entrance become smaller, slowing
> the pace of the walker as he or she entrains to the new shorter
> pattern (Figure 10.7). The same can be done in gamespace: wider
> rhythmic architectural elements in prospect spaces, such as buildings
> in urban driving games or shooters, pull users through large
> circulation paths, and when players encounter areas where they are
> immersed in a rhythm of smaller or more intimate elements, they tend
> to stop and explore the space before moving on.
>
> Varying Structural Rhythms
>
> While gameplay occurs rhythmically and can entrain players to its
> rhythms to drive them forward, another element of keeping player
> engagement with rhythmic game structure is to layer rhythms on top of
> one another. This type of layering is evident when designers give
> players a series of long- and short-term goals in a game. Long-term
> goals form their own rhythm of "big" events---boss battles, cutscenes,
> story events, etc. This forms the foundational structure of the game,
> as in, "this game has eight levels," or "this game's story has four
> chapters." Within these larger structures lie individual stages
> (worlds 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3), tasks, puzzles, or enemy encounters that
> create shorter and shorter-term goals.
>
> When diagrammed, these goals begin to form rhythmic patterns. Major
> game rhythms may be marked with hierarchically more important lines,
> while other goals are given thinner and thinner lines according to
> their importance (Figure 10.8). In architectural façade design, such
> pat- terns of layered structural elements have been referred to as
> *tartans*, after the fabric pattern common in Scottish clothing.25
> Architectural tartan patterns are constructed of alternating
> structural or façade elements of different hierarchical importance:
> from actual columns to window frames (Figure 10.9). In terms of
> gamespace rhythms, there can be *entrainment*

> *tartans* based on large prospect-space rhythmic elements and more

> tartans well in the combat-ready streets of Columbia: buildings and
> islands form large- scale rhythms that draw players from one climactic
> battle to another. However, players who explore individual structures
> will find richly devel- oped reward spaces and embedded narrative
> spaces (Figure 10.10). The development of tartan-like rhythms in
> gamespace can have great effect on both the large-scale structure of a

## COMPLEMENTING LEVEL DESIGN WITH AMBIENT SOUND

> We have just discussed a major portion of a game's soundscape, music.
> However, there are other factors that contribute greatly to building a
> game's audio modality. One of these is *ambient sound*, sound effects
> that build environmental context. Here we look at two methods for
> employing ambient sounds and how they enhance our understanding of
> gamespace. The terminology we use is borrowed from the Unity engine
> and how it models how sounds work in space: *2D sound* and *3D sound*.
>
> 2D Sound
>
> The first and more simple of the two sound models we explore is 2D
> sound. Music and contextual environmental sound effects such as wind,
> rustling trees, or distant urban sounds can be considered 2D sound.
> These sounds are played over a scene without regard for the distance
> of the source from the game's viewpoint. For example, a game in which
> the player character or non-player characters talk will often utilize
> 2D sound so the dialog can be heard. Game music is typically played
> over a scene, rather than from a specific source. While these sounds
> lack actual spatial implementation, they have other uses in building
> environmental context or atmosphere.
>
> This type of environmental development is exemplified in *Slender: The
> Eight Pages* by Parsec Productions.27 The game's developer, Mark
> Hadley, is a sound designer, and utilizes changes in ambient noise to
>
> describe the state of gameplay as players progress. At the beginning
> of the game, players can hear typical nighttime forest sounds:
> chirping crick- ets, wind rustling through trees, etc. As players
> collect pages, however, the ambient noise becomes increasingly
> ominous, starting with a steady drumbeat and eventually including
> different unsettling tones. *Slender* is notable for its use of
> negative space, building the feeling of being vulner- able within a
> large prospect space through a thick shroud of darkness. The 2D
> soundscape of this game aids this notion. The drumming can be
> described as the footsteps of Slender Man as he stalks players, and
> some- times seen as simply scary sound effects. Either way, these
> sounds, which signal that players have the attention of the titular
> malevolent entity, give the impression of both distance and closeness.
> This aids the negative space and the antagonist's random spawning
> mechanics by making Slender Man's location relative to the player seem
> ambiguous. The lack of fading in and out for this soundscape likewise
> gives Slender Man an air of omnipo- tence in the gamespace, creating a
> tense atmosphere.
>
> *Dead Man's Trail* utilizes sound to establish game state and hint at
> the world beyond the gamespace. Ambient noises of nature are used in
> many of the game's looting levels to establish setting. However, this
> quickly fades and becomes the dirge of zombie voices as the horde
> moves closer. Sound in this game has three purposes: to establish
> setting, to place the level in a much more vast world, and to inform
> players of how much time is left to loot. Each looting level allows
> players only a limited time before a large zombie horde arrives.
> Instead of a timer, ambient sound forces players to listen for the
> proximity of the horde and plan their looting accordingly.
>
> Two-dimensional space is useful for scenarios in which the vastness of
> level space must be established, or for important sounds that must be
> heard by the player. There are also sounds whose ability to wax and
> wane with player proximity further enhance gamespace.
>
> 3D Sound
>
> Beyond the singular volume of 2D sound is 3D sound, sound that becomes
> louder as players near its source. Where 2D sound excels at
> establishing the atmosphere of a gamespace, 3D sound calls attention
> to specific areas of a level. This can be useful for enhancing the
> size of a gamespace, guiding players through space, or as audio clues
> to secret passages.
>
> Of sound effects in landscaping, David Slawson says that "auditory
> effects, such as the muffled and therefore 'distant' sound of a
> waterfall,
>
> also may be employed to heighten the sense of near and far."28 These
> types of sounds can guide players by establishing a sense of proximity
> to specific objects or areas. In *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
> Princess*,29 this effect is used early in the game to guide players
> through the Ordon Woods area. Players must listen for the singing of
> an important character to reach a narrative-important area and learn
> how to ride Link's horse. In *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*,30
> music is used in the Lost Woods area to guide players through a
> difficult maze. The maze is divided into rooms with four exits, and
> players must pause near each exit to test whether the music gets
> louder or softer (Figure 10.11). *Portal*31 uses a similar tactic to
> alert players to secrets: radios playing an instrumental version of
> Jonathan Coulton's *Still Alive* are strewn throughout levels. By
> offering in-game achievements to players for finding them, the
> developers turn listening for a specific song or sound into an
> exploration game of its own.
>
> Sounds can create interesting opportunities to alert players to danger
> or disrupt their play. When creating especially powerful enemies or
> plac- ing them in levels, giving them unique sounds can add further
> tension to encounters with them. In *Half-Life 2*, the poison headcrab
> enemies, whose attacks leave players greatly weakened, have a distinct
> rattling sound. Valve employees have noted that during playtesting,
> testers would drop whatever they were otherwise doing in the game to
> concentrate on destroying poison headcrabs if they heard the
> rattling.32 Likewise, clickers

## ENHANCING GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCES WITH SOUND DESIGN

> The use of sound as indicators of approaching enemies or to mark path-
> ways shows us that like art assets, sound assets can be symbolic. As
> players play *Half-Life 2*, they are trained to understand how a
> rattling sound indi- cates the presence of poison headcrabs. Like many
> *Half-Life* series enemy introductions, the first encounter with them
> occurs in an isolated fash- ion, in a room where they are one of the
> only enemies, so players can see what effect their attacks have and
> learn about the sounds they make (Figure 10.13). In *The Last of Us*,
> players are taught about clickers through a cutscene that clearly
> shows how they are visually distinguishable from other enemies, and
> through an easily overcome encounter where players can hear the sounds
> they make (Figure 10.14).
>
> Karen Collins addresses this element of game sound, stating, "The con-
> cept of interactive sound as being event-driven suggests that events
> are repeatable---that if we repeat the action, we will receive the
> same reac- tion."34 She states that this repeatability is important
> for giving players feedback for their actions in games. Indeed, our
> idea of sound as symbolic assets in games is what allows us to use it
> as another tool for training players, rewarding them, or giving them
> other feedback for their actions. Even in situations where the quality
> of sound design rests on random- ized variations of sounds (such as
> gunshots or footsteps of characters), she argues, audio feedback gives
> the impression that the players' actions have

> Sound as Gameplay Feedback
>
> We discussed earlier how interaction with elements in gamespace often
> elicits sound effects or musical tones. In *Flower*, we saw how
> interacting with closed flowers created notes that were added to the
> game's music (Figure 10.15). Weapons in many games often play
> satisfying effects when used: loud bangs for guns, explosions for
> rocket launchers, and clangs for swords.
>
> If we are to consider sound effects in games as symbolic assets, we
> have to understand how they produce feelings of agency for player
> activity. In terms of characters, a pleasant "bwooop" when a character
> jumps and a jagged "err err err" buzzer when characters are hit become
> positive reinforcements and punishments, respectively, in response to
> player actions. Jumping in games is often a positive action, while
> being hit by enemy fire is a nega- tive one. In *Bit.Trip* games,
> successful navigation of the game's environment plays a pleasant
> electronic note, while missing these opportunities plays an awkward
> click or thud sound. This use of sound complements the train- ing
> methods discussed that utilize symbolic assets and rewards. As players

> Audio feedback is also useful for directing players within gamespace.
> Triggers in certain areas can be scripted to play pleasant melodies
> when play- ers perform actions there. In *Year Walk*,36 players must
> at one point navigate a cave by selecting from an array of identical
> pathways. By listening for spe- cific notes at each path, players can
> discern which way to go. The notes that lead players in the proper
> direction are pleasant and in major keys, while the notes that return
> players to the beginning of the cave are in harsh minor keys. In
> *Slender*, players hear jarring bursts of static whenever Slender Man
> comes into view. This is an important trigger for players, as a
> primary mechanic of the game is to avoid seeing the character, which
> results in the player dying and the game ending. Especially during the
> early portions of the game, it is possible for Slender Man to be
> directly in front of players, but far enough away that trees or
> darkness obscure him. Audio is impor- tant here, as it gives players
> an indication that the antagonist is nearby and they must not continue
> in his direction. Sound helps dictate the player's interaction with
> Slender Man, and it also gives players warnings that steer
>
> them away from unfair deaths.
>
> Symbolic game objects can have their own symbolic audio assets. Levers
> can make a satisfying click when pulled, doors can open with a heavy
> grinding sound, etc. When played in response to player actions in a
> level, they give the impression that the player has somehow greatly
> affected the gamespace. When the object that players are interacting
> with is directly on screen, hearing the sounds an object makes has a

>
> Sound as Reward
>
> Sometimes the audio feedback from important events or difficult
> puzzles triggers the playing of more triumphant audio assets. Audio
> feedback is being used here as a reward for in-game actions. In
> *Zelda* games, jin- gles play whenever players solve a puzzle in a
> room or gain a new item. The same is true for most action-adventure
> games⎯a unique chime or tune plays in response to player victory.
> Rewards can be some of the most multimodal experiences in games. In
> terms of interactivity, they come after players have overcome
> challenges or performed an important in-game action. Rewards often
> have a visual component---the sprite or 3D
>
> model of the reward object, or some visually rewarding space. Audio
> also ties the experience together with upbeat celebratory fanfare.
> Like the link between interactive and visual modalities, the
> combination of a sound effect with a specific and repeatable game
> event closely links the sound and game event together.
>
> Audio rewards in games are not necessarily rewards in and of them-
> selves, but are used to enhance other types of rewards or guide the
> emo- tions of players in rewarding scenes. When gaining access to a
> new weapon or ability, which in Salen and Zimmerman terms would be a
> reward of facility,37 players may hear a heroic tune. The sound played
> in a reward vault, rewarding vista, or meditative space may have a
> relaxing melody when compared with the intense rhythms that possibly
> accompanied any preceding challenges. In these ways, sound in games
> can move us through the dramatic arcs of individual gameplay
> challenges.
>
> Sound as Narrative Indicators
>
> Sound can clue players in to the narrative state of a game. As we have
> seen, sound in games is largely *incidental*, designed for
> accompaniment of performed events. However, sounds can also give
> insight into elements of gamespace that are themselves narrative
> indicators.
>
> In Chapter 7, "Storytelling in Gamespace," we discussed how textures
> indicate the narrative state of games with regard to the hero's
> journey. As a game moves forward, the state or type of materiality
> indicated through art assets typically deteriorates: green fields give
> way to the wet stones of dun- geons, lava of volcanoes, or ominous
> metals of alien cities. Sound can fill in gaps of our understanding of
> gamespace materiality left by our inability to touch gamespace. It can
> enhance prospects with echoes, make grass in fields seem plush with
> sumptuous rustling, or enhance the eeriness of swamps with thick
> sloshing that makes the player's skin crawl when he or she thinks of
> what his or her avatar is walking in.
>
> Even the music of a gamespace can be a material indicator. In *Sword &
> Sworcery EP*, Jim Guthrie's music not only guides gameplay mood, but
> also enhances the material awareness of players in specific scenes.
> The Dream World has slow, melodic music that echoes faintly, making
> the entire space seem ethereal. Battles with the game's main
> antagonist, the Gogolithic Mass, feature heavy but sharp percussions
> that recall the sound of crunch- ing armor and bone. The careful use
> of these types of evocative music and sound assets greatly enhance the
> material reality of gamespaces and the experience of interacting with
> them.

## SUMMARY

> While level designers and architects mainly consider the visual and
> inter- active elements of space, video games also allow the use of
> audio enhance- ments to our designs. In this chapter, we have explored
> how music and sound affect player moods and can be used to enhance
> emotional responses to gamespace. We have also seen how sounds in
> games cre- ate rhythms that, if utilized in certain ways, can cause
> players to expect them. These expected rhythms in musical composition,
> game structuring, and game level construction can affect the speed of
> how players interact with games, or offer layered game experiences
> through differently scaled challenges.
>
> We also explored how game sound exists in video games: through both
> overlaid 2D sound and location-specific 3D sound. These sounds offer
> opportunities for describing the nature of gameplay elements and
> gamespaces in different ways: do certain elements overwhelm a
> gamespace, as in many horror games where monster effects fill a level,
> or are they guideposts that lead players to destinations? These types
> of sounds may also be used to create a sense of great distance through
> muffled location- specific sound effects or faint 2D soundscapes.
>
> Lastly, we looked at how specific sound effects can enhance gamespace
> experiences discussed earlier in the book. Sounds can give feedback
> for specific mechanics or be rewards for important gameplay tasks.
> These enhance the ways that gamespaces train players and the
> experience of earning rewards. Sound effects can give narrative
> context to gamespaces by describing their materiality. Partnered with
> visual representations of materials, players get a sense of how it
> feels to be in a gamespace despite not physically inhabiting it.
>
> In Chapter 11, we address gamespaces that blur the lines between game
> worlds and the real world. We will learn how designers use both high-
> and low-tech methods to give real-world spaces game contexts, and even
> cause real-world good.

> Eric Zimmerman is a game designer and academic who has been in the
> indus- try for nearly twenty years. He co-founded Gamelab in 2000, a
> company that during its operation won numerous awards at the
> Independent Games
>
> Festival, Games For Change, and other events. He co-authored *Rules of
> Play: Game Design Fundamentals* with Katie Salen in 2004, has been
> creating games playable in public spaces such as *Meta Game*, and has
> collaborated with architect Nathalie Pozzi on several urban
> installation game projects.
>
> *Can you name a game, level, or level designer (or multiples of each)
> whose work has left an impression on you? Why?*
>
> Every game I play leaves some kind of impression on me. Even if I
> don't like it, it's important to take note of why. Getting in touch
> with one's own plea- sure and aesthetic reactions to games and other
> forms of culture is important for game designers to cultivate.
>
> *Are there any media outside of gaming that you find inspire your
> work?*
>
> There is not a media outside of games that does not inspire my work.
>
> *Describe your level design process---how do you begin? What tools do
> you use (on or off the computer)?*
>
> Since I work on and off the computer, on extremely different kinds of
> games, there is not a single process. The only common denominator is a
> very strongly iterative process based on lots of playtesting.
>
> *Do you find art and atmospheric effects an important tool for
> communicating with players? Any specific examples?*
>
> The experiential aspects of games are always important to take into
> account. For example, in my recent board game *Quantum*, the
> illustrations and bits of narrative sprinkled throughout the game are
> very important in cementing the game's meaning. Each card signifies in
> four ways: title, functional subtitle, effect description, and
> illustration. The card as a unit in the game's process relies on all
> of these elements.
>
> *How do you teach players to utilize your levels (without use of the
> GUI)?*
>
> It varies radically per game. The foundation is an intuitive
> interface, early levels that let players explore through trial and
> error, and playtesting any help or tutorial functionality.
>
> *How do you entice players to explore game levels (without use of the
> GUI)?*
>
> By having an engaging, repeatable core mechanic.
>
> *How do you direct the actions of players in your levels? How do you
> encour- age players to play in undirected ways?*
>
> By setting player expectations properly about the type of game that
> they are playing.
>
> *You've worked on a great number of games, both digital and physical.
> How have you seen digital gamespaces direct the experience of game-
> play? How have you seen the physical space around a game (either
> digital or non-digital) direct game experiences?*
>
> The only way to answer such a big question is to say that directing
> players around a space (a physical space, a space of possible action,
> a space of
>
> meaning, a social space, etc.) is part of the core design challenge of
> making any game.
>
> Meta Game*, which you designed with Local No. 12, has been featured
> sev- eral times at the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San
> Francisco. How do you see games like this as an influencer of social
> interactions in real-world events or contexts?*
>
> I don't see the game as influencing social events. I see the game
> piggyback- ing on existing social interactions between players. The
> game was designed to take advantage of the ways that people are
> already interacting at GDC.
>
> *Some of your recent projects have been collaborations between
> yourself and architect Nathalie Pozzi. How do you begin these
> projects: with a game idea, architectural idea/parti, or an intended
> experience?*
>
> Each of our five projects has begun differently. Often we are
> responding to a particular space or context for a commission. Other
> times they begin with a gameplay idea or with an idea for designing
> the physical space in a particular way.
>
> *What is the relationship between the architectural spaces in your
> recent games and the games themselves? If you remove one, how does or
> could the other change?*
>
> Again, the relationship is different for each game. Ideally, they are
> intertwined. Our first game, *Sixteen Tons*, can be played as a
> tabletop game (although it loses something). Our most recent game,
> *Interference*, absolutely requires the physical installation in order
> to be played.
>
> *If you were to design the world for a digital game after working on
> these games and architecture projects, are there lessons that you
> would utilize that you've learned from real-world gamespaces?*
>
> Yes. I am utilizing those lessons now. The biggest one is that the
> design of space can greatly impact the play of the game, even if the
> space has nothing to do with the structure of the game or the
> functioning of the game rules.
