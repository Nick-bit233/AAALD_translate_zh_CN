> As an experiential medium, games allow players to connect with on-

> stories; the author predetermines the events. Games, however, give
> players a sense of *agency* over the stories of games through the
> ability to craft their game- play narrative through decisions and
> achievement. The ability to influ- ence the story extends to the

> finale. One common failure condition in games is death, playing into

## SURVIVAL INSTINCTS AND PLAYER AVATARS

> As explored in Chapter 1, many of the mechanics common in today's
> video games stem from early non-digital arcade, pinball, and carnival
> games. Many of these games were run by barkers, vendors who attract
> passers-by to entertainment events, who charged players for chances to
> accomplish the game's goals. In games where this transaction was
> automated, such as many pinball games, players that stayed in the game
> through buying extra chances could earn even more chances by achieving
> high scores or
>
> reaching specific goals. For both psychological and economic reasons,
> staying alive to continue adding to one's score became a hallmark of
> the medium. Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari and former arcade
> barker, brought this thinking into early digital arcade games such as
> *Computer Space*5 and *Pong*.6 Manipulating a player's desire to keep
> playing while making the game too difficult to complete without paying
> for extra chances meant that arcade games became very lucrative. Soon
> this was common in the video game industry as it had been in pinball
> and carnival games. Even after video games entered the home, many
> games still uti- lized the rhetoric of "scores," "lives," and
> "continues" to mark the progress of players, even when players did not
> have to pay for extra chances. What began as an economic design
> decision had become a design paradigm.
>
> Today, ensuring the survival of one's avatar is still an important
> part of many games, even though we have shed many mechanics held over
> from arcade games. While many modern games do not feature a life or
> game over system, they still allow players to fail in different ways.
> Even when not given the metaphor of health or survival, many games
> still feature a mechanic where the player is eliminated from play and
> must return to a previous checkpoint in levels. Post-arcade era games
> also allow players to spend more time interacting with their avatars,
> as these games are built around long play sessions. This causes
> players to become very attached to the characters they are trying to
> protect from game-ending death.
>
> Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
>
> Our tendency toward involving survival in games comes not only from
> industry traditions, but also from survival instincts. In his paper "A
> Theory of Human Motivation," Abraham Maslow proposed a *hierarchy of
> needs* that describes how humans prioritize their motivations. In this
> hierarchy, physiological needs such as shelter, food, and sleep rank
> among the most important, while self-actualization needs such as
> creativity and problem solving are among the least important7 (Figure
> 5.1). Even now, these hier- archical needs influence our feelings
> toward much in the world around us. In *Origins of Architectural
> Pleasure*, architect Grant Hildebrand studies humanity's shelter-based
> survival instincts and proposes a series of spa- tial principles for
> creating pleasurable spaces based on architectures that humanity has
> historically found safe.
>
> As argued in the Gamasutra article "Designing Better Levels Through
> Human Survival Instincts,"8 from which much of the content in this

> addressing both the survival of player avatars and historic notions of
> safe spaces. To do so, we must look at our gamespaces as not only
> levels meant to maximize the mechanics of a game in a friendly
> fashion, but also spaces for creating dramatic tension through close
> calls with failure. Modernist architects dealt with buildings as
> places for enacting the actions of liv- ing. To quote the original
> Gamasutra article, "If to architects the house was the machine for
> living, the game level should be the machine for living, dying, and
> creating tension by exploiting everything in between." In this
> section, we will explore different ways that game avatars become
> invaluable parts of our experiences with gamespaces that players will
> want to protect.
>
> The Problem of the Protagonist
>
> The game avatar's ability to fail is one way that it becomes relatable
> for game players. As a resource for continued gameplay, the avatar is
> valu- able and must be protected. Its vulnerability taps into our own
> survival instincts and need to protect ourselves from exterior
> dangers. Architecture and level design differ from one another in the
> way they handle dangers. According to Hildebrand, architects should
> strive for pleasurable spaces through the contrast of safe and unsafe
> architectures that ultimately favor safety. In level design, we can be
> much more heavy-handed with utiliza- tion of dangerous elements, as
> the risk of failure through loss of life or gameplay chances is
> ingrained in the experience. This also extends to gam- ing's use of
> enemies. Excluding our investigation of the Cretan labyrinth
>
> in Chapter 3, few architects design structures with monsters as part
> of the design. However, enemies can be an important element of many
> video game levels and should be carefully planned as part of the
> experience of gamespaces.
>
> In nature, humans have very few defenses against predatory and envi-
> ronmental hazards. Therefore, we have had to utilize our ability to
> construct shelters and tools to circumvent our lack of claws, spines,
> poisons, and other natural enhancements.8 Just as man searched his
> surroundings for ways to overcome danger, encounters with enemies in
> games help facilitate gameplay goals of enhancing player characters
> through resource finding. This theme of utilizing tools and
> *power-ups* to enhance characters beyond their natural state of
> weakness is common through many games, so much so that we can call it
> the *problem of the protagonist.*
>
> *Problem of the Protagonist as a Game Structure*
>
> This scenario taps into our own quest for natural growth and enhance-
> ment over time. It is utilized in games such as *The Legend of Zelda*9
> and *Metroid*10 and in role-playing games such as *Dragon Quest*11 as
> game struc- tures: players are confined to a small territory of a
> large map by either pow- erful enemies or an environmental obstacle
> they cannot cross. As players explore their territory, they can find
> enhancements that allow them to move outside the territory or more
> easily defeat monsters that previously held them back (Figure 5.2).

>
> *Problem of the Protagonist in Individual Game Challenges*
>
> The problem of the protagonist does not need to be an entire game
> struc- ture. Utilizing the *Nintendo Power* method of game design from
> Chapter 2, problem of the protagonist exploration areas can be
> injected into individual high or low moments of gameplay. As we will
> see, the implementation of these systems depends greatly on the
> survival mechanics in the game itself. In the article "Seeing Red: The
> Pitfalls of Regenerating Health," Eric Schwarz argues that the
> addition of regenerating health in games, a system where an avatar's
> health state increases over time while not being damaged,
> fundamentally changed how game levels and challenges are structured.12
> This mechanic, he contends, made game challenges more immediate and
> even by allowing players to pause, regenerate, then move forward to
> the next challenge without having to explore for resources---a
> mechanic very conducive to the pacing of online multiplayer games.
> However, he also contends that regenerating health diminishes the
> pleasure of finding hid- den objects through exploration and the drama
> of surviving challenges
>
> with low health in single-player scenarios.
>
> While these mechanics are mostly utilized in first-person shooters,
> the concept of engaging health systems is central to our exploration
> of survival in level design and how to deal with avatar survival
> mechanics in individual encounters. If form indeed follows core
> mechanics, we must understand how drama is created in individual
> scenarios through a game's system of survival mechanics and structure
> our level's design around maximizing these mechanics. Games where
> avatars internalize many resource functions through regeneration, such
> as *Halo: Reach*,13 structure high and low moments much more
> straightforwardly: battles occur in large areas where players defend
> themselves by finding cover or stealing enemy tools (Figure 5.3).
>
> In games where players must manage exterior survival resources, how-
> ever, spaces where players encounter enemies can create vastly
> different experiences based on the ways they are structured. This is
> due to these games' ability to have varied *game states*, which in

## PROSPECT AND REFUGE SPATIAL DESIGN

>
> A core element of Hildebrand's survival-based architectural concepts
> stems from how such spaces are contrasted against one another to
> create linked sequences of safe and unsafe spaces. He calls these
> spaces *prospects* and *refuges*.14
>
> We have defined prospect spaces as open spaces where one is vulnerable
> to attack, such as those encountered by early humans who had to
> explore wide plains to find food and other resources. A refuge, on the
> other hand, is the contrast to prospect spaces that early humans would
> return to after their hunt: an intimate-sized space that was shielded
> from view and from which humans could look out onto prospect spaces to
> evaluate threats (Figure 5.6). The ability to evaluate threats is
> important when discussing prospect and refuge spaces, as it is this
> relationship between refuges and prospects that allows us to create
> gamespaces with this concept.
>
> Creating Paths with Refuges, Prospects, and Secondary Refuges
>
> While one would typically assume that refuges describe permanent
> living structures, this is not always the case. Borrowing from D.M.
> Woodcock,15 Hildebrand divides prospect and refuge further into
> *primary prospects, primary refuges*, *secondary prospects*, and
> *secondary refuges.* Primary pros- pects and refuges are those we are
> immediately engaged in: the refuge we currently occupy and the
> prospect we are looking out onto from our refuge.

> scenarios.
>
> Secondary refuges and prospects are those in the distance⎯the refuge
> on the other side of the primary prospect, and the prospect beyond
> that (Figure 5.7). From a level design standpoint, we are concerned
> with planning all of these spatial types. However, from a player
> perspective, we are concerned mainly with the relationships between
> refuges, prospects, and secondary refuges. These spaces can create
> exciting gameplay scenarios when used in proper sequence: running from
> cover point to cover point in a shoot- ing game, moving from one
> hiding spot to another in a stealth game, and
>
> many others (Figure 5.8).
>
> Prospects and Refuges in Architecture
>
> Prospects and refuges are a mainstay in real-world architecture. In
> many works, prospect and refuge spaces are used to create a sense of
> *public-private* contrast: where there are separate spaces for both
> social and individual activities in a design. When dealing with
> public-private in the context of prospect-refuge, spaces for private
> actions are placed in enclosed refuges, while public gathering or
> circulation spaces are larger prospect spaces. As Hildebrand points
> out, architectural refuge spaces are often on a different horizontal
> plane than prospect spaces: higher to provide an advantageous view or
> lower to provide a cloistered hiding space. He also emphasizes
> *ceiling height* as essential for differentiating the two: lower
> ceilings create the feeling of greater protection.16 So prospect

> The IT University of Copenhagen's atrium, designed by Henning Larsen
> Architects, is one example of how prospect-refuge forms become public-
> private spaces (Figure 5.9). The atrium is a large public prospect

> Issues of prospect and refuge are deeply engrained in the design ide-
> als of two of the most famous modern architects, Le Corbusier and
>
> Frank Lloyd Wright. Le Corbusier's architecture has been described as

> Le Corbusier's points emphasize openness and the ability to see from
> one space to another. This is evident in his most famous work, Villa
> Savoye---built at Poissy-sur-Seine in 1929---whose wide living spaces
> are lifted by thin columns and surrounded by wide views of the house's
> exterior (Figure 5.11). Ramps rise from the ground floor, which houses
> servants' quarters, to the roof terrace on the third level, with each
> level having a better view of the wide open spaces underneath (Figure

> Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture, on the other hand, is largely
> refuge based. His works feature low, broad ceilings, natural
> materials, and expan- sive views of the outside consistent with the

> that the hearth was a central element of the house, and he featured
> them prominently in the center of many of his most famous works.19 He
> utilized depressed sitting areas (Figure 5.13), large exterior
> overhangs that concealed those within (Figure 5.14), and dictated that
> perspective drawings of his designs be shown surrounded by trees
> (Figure 5.15). As Hildebrand suggests, this suggests a tendency toward
> concealment20 in many of Wright's works.

> Prospects and Refuges in Video Games
>
> An obvious application of prospects and refuges in video games comes
> from the stealth subgenre in games such as *Metal Gear Solid*.21 In
> *Metal Gear Solid*, players progress through the game's levels by
> finding refuges from which they can discern the placement of enemy
> guards in prospect territories. Once they have done so, they can move
> through the prospect spaces to secondary refuges, and so on (Figure
> 5.16). This shows how pros- pects and refuges can be used to create
> discrete paths in games.
>
> When utilizing prospect and refuge gameplay in this way, enemies
> become important architectural elements and the level itself a spatial
> puz- zle. In *The Nightmare Over Innsmouth*,22 a companion game to the
> GDC China presentation of "Designing Better Levels Through Human
> Survival Instincts,"23 enemy behavior design and placement was
> imperative for turn- ing a courtyard into a prospect-refuge gamespace.
> In this game, based on the H.P. Lovecraft novella *The Shadow Over
> Innsmouth*,24 the player must escape his or her hotel room by crossing
> rooftop beams, descending into a courtyard, and escaping through an
> empty house while evil towns- people pursue him or her. The courtyard
> is designed to utilize prospects and refuges in different ways.
> Players enter the courtyard from the lower level of a house, whose
> bottom door is on a lower level than the courtyard itself (Figure
> 5.17). From here they can look into the courtyard and see the entrance
> to the safe house, highlighted with orange light to contrast with the
> blue coloring of the courtyard, as well as the patrol paths of several

## SHADE, SHADOW, AND SURVIVAL

> We have just explored prospects and refuges---wide open bright spaces
> and comfortably enclosed dark spaces. As we have seen, humanity's
> rela- tionship with spatial sizes is simple: if a space is too large
> or too small, it is uncomfortable. However, if a space is
> accommodating to the abilities of a human or game avatar, it is
> pleasurable.
>
> Our relationships with the *lighting conditions* of these spaces,
> however, are not so clearly defined. While discussing refuges,
> Hildebrand suggests that their low lighting conditions offer
> concealment from exterior dangers located in the brightly lit
> prospect. However, he later describes other transitions from light to
> dark as "not so pleasant."31 He attributes this to the strategic
> advan- tage of "seeing without being seen"32 when one is hiding in the
> dark. As one moves from dark to light, he may instead be the one who
> is being watched.
>
> Architect Christopher Alexander, on the other hand, advocates for
> lighting conditions as a device for pulling occupants through space.
> In *A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction*,33 Alexander
> describes how light may be used at junctions where the designer would
> like to lead occupants (Figure 5.22). In our previous discussions of
> contrast, lighting was an important element of emphasizing points
> along a path. Here we explore these elements of humanity's
> relationship with light and dark, and how they create dramatic
> gameplay experiences.

> their gamespaces. One such condition is *shade*. Shade is accomplished
> by allowing diffused lighting into a space through curtains, screens,
> or stained glass. It was a major feature of Gothic architecture, which
> strove to create an ethereal experience called *lux nova*, or "new
> light." This condi- tion was also known as "mystic light" and was used
> to bring occupants of these churches closer to God. Shade is also a
> mainstay of the horror genre, with danger obscured by walls of mist.
>
> Whether it is ultimately used to enhance beneficial or dangerous
> spaces, shade is known to create a sense of *enticement* in humans. As
> Hildebrand points out, incomplete visual information entices humans to
> explore and complete their knowledge of what they see.34 Rhythmic ele-
> ments such as the columns in the Great Mosque of Cordoba (Figure 5.23)
> or the pattern of openings and partially revealed galleries in Carlos
> Scarpa's Castelvecchio Museum (Figure 5.24) further entice occupants
> to move through a space. Combined with shade, the result is a nearly
> inescapable need to explore.
>
> Shade is an important element of many video games, as its ability to
> represent both sacred and malevolent spaces allows it to create *atmo-
> spheric ambiguity*⎯a condition where the player is unsure of whether a
> space is safe or unsafe due to a combination of friendly, unfriendly,
> and ambiguous spatial indicators. *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
> Princess*,35 for example, utilizes both shade and prospect spaces for
> the interiors of many dungeons. As players wander through
> environments, they are left to wonder whether some large spaces are
> cathedrals that hold an important, sacred item or are the den of an
> evil monster (Figure 5.25).

> Such effects can be created in engines by thoughtfully placing light

> real-time lighting, dramatic lighting can be accomplished via *light
> baking* in con- tent creation programs---having the program render a
> color map for the environment that includes lighting information. Many
> engines feature *light mapping* capabilities, which produce a texture
> that contains lighting
>
> information, reducing the need for real-time lighting in areas where
> lighting will not change significantly.
>
> In the mobile game *SWARM!*,36 the limitations of the target devices
> only allowed for one directional light: a light object that casts an
> infinite beam of light in a single direction, much like the sun.
> Therefore, designers had to carefully place each light in the angle
> that they wished the light in the scene to come from and tweak the
> object's settings. As *SWARM!* was built in Unity, these settings
> included the ambient lighting color of the level scene, the intensity
> of the light itself, and its color. With some creative tweaking, many
> different lighting conditions could be created with only one light
> (Figure 5.27).
>
> On her blog Love Conquers All Games, game designer Christine Love
> describes how similar effects were created by the very limited
> four-shades- of-gray color palettes available on the Nintendo Game Boy
> and colorized on the Super Game Boy. In her article on colorization on
> the Super Game Boy, she describes how being able to only use four
> colors for an entire envi- ronment led to more evocative moods in
> games like *World Heroes 2 Jet*37 or *King of Fighters '96*38 when
> compared to their fully colored arcade coun- terparts.39 Though modern
> 2D color palettes vary, one can see how shade effects can be
> accomplished by creating scenes with dominant color palettes.
>
> Shadow
>
> While shade is a diffusion of light that presents a mid-ground between
> light and dark, *shadow* is the condition created when an object
> obscures the light source and leaves a lack of light. Like shade,
> shadow has both pos- itive and negative uses. For example, shadows
> fulfill Hildebrand's afore- mentioned description of the lighting
> within refuge spaces. They obscure those within from view and allow
> them to have a strategic advantage over opponents. This mirrors the
> friendly associations shadows hold for writ- ers such as Junʼichiro
> Tanizaki, who, in his essay *In Praise of Shadows*,40 reflects on the
> Japanese's relationship with shadows in their aesthetics, praising
> their subtlety and contemplative nature against the garish shine and
> brightness of Western objects.
>
> The developers of the original *Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell*41
> understood this when designing levels for their game, and conceived of
> the shadows in the game's environments as different spaces than those
> in the light. For this, they coined the term *shadowspace* to describe

>
> Negative Space
>
> Even when there is no danger within dark corners of caves or
> gamespaces, the psychological effect of the unknown cannot be ignored.
> In games, architecture, and media, darkness is just one way that
> designers build the perception of *negative space*. In art and graphic
> design, negative space is unused or blank space in a work, the
> exposure of the background. For our purposes, negative space refers to
> that which is unknown to the player, viewer, or occupant. In
> storytelling this can be the mystery surrounding the motivations of
> the player. In level design, this can apply to creating anxiety by
> making players unaware of what surrounds them.
>
> In many ways, negative space is a way to bolster the effectiveness of
> prospect spaces as it works best when there is a perception of a
> *beyond* to the gamespace, or that it extends past what the player can
> see. One such example is the game *Slender: The Eight Pages* by Parsec
> Productions.44 In this game, players must search dark woods for eight
> pages armed with only a flashlight as they are pursued by a malevolent
> entity known as the Slender Man. The game's very structure is negative
> space: the environ- ment is a large wooded prospect space shrouded in
> thick shadows. Slender Man is not a character with a set location or
> movement capabilities,
>
> but rather is scripted to randomly45 spawn around the player. This
> lends an air of mystery to him, as players are unsure of where he will
> be as they move around. The combination of the heavily shadowed
> environment and the Slender Man's method of movement give Slender Man
> omnipotence over the gameplay. Even when he is not on screen, the
> player is aware that he may be anywhere in the environment---a feeling
> enhanced by the game's sound design. Thus Slender Man ceases to be
> simply a humanoid figure, but also is embodied by the shadows.
>
> In addition to its use with shadow, negative space has been used to
> add a feeling of malevolent unknown to environmental elements, such as
> bod- ies of water or architectural spaces. In the film *Jaws*,46
> director Stephen Spielberg withheld a view of the film's monster, a
> great white shark, for an hour---showing only views from the shark's
> perspective whenever it was stalking bathers. This decision on
> Spielberg's part made the shark synony- mous with the water itself.
> Similarly, many science fiction-themed games utilize sound effects to
> create the impression that the world surround- ing the player is
> bigger than the space directly around the player avatar. *Dead
> Space*47 utilizes shadow and sound effects to create the impression
> that monsters are running through ventilation ducts and other
> structures within a large space ship. The *Metroid* series utilizes
> musical themes that are at times more like *soundscapes* rather than
> actual melodies.
>
> Lighting conditions and negative space are both useful methods of not
> only putting players in interesting survival scenarios where their
> enemies are unknown, but also enticing players with withheld
> information or atmospheric ambiguity.
>
> In the final section of this chapter, we will look at another
> environmen- tal element that humanity has a dualistic relationship
> with: height.

## LOVING AND HATING HEIGHT

> Just as we both fear and utilize shadow and shade as environmental
> tools, we have a similar relationship with height. While it is common
> to have a fear of heights, heights can also give a strategic advantage
> by allowing occupants of high places to look down on opponents below.
> In video games, sniper characters often utilize this tactic. In
> multiplayer games, sniping spots are often valuable areas for players
> to have control of, as they offer a refuge with a wide view of the
> map. Many strategy games feature mechanics where extra offensive or
> defensive capabilities are given to units located on higher terrain.
> In these ways, height is very beneficial indeed.
>
> However, height can also provide an overwhelming sense of danger in
> gamespaces. While when one is situated comfortably on a high
> precipice, there is a sense that the high place is a refuge, placing
> an occupant at a high point with little between him or her and the
> fall creates a stressful experience (Figure 5.31).
>
> *The Nightmare Over Innsmouth* explores both elements of height early
> in the level (Figure 5.32). Near the beginning, the player is forced
> to cross the structural beams of caved-in rooftops to reach safety. As
> the beams are the width of the character, crossing them is perilous
> and requires

> converge at a point because of perspective distortion, they create a
> visual pull toward the bottom of the pit, making the height more
> intense (Figure 5.33). This is an architectural method modeled after
> Gothic churches such as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Chartres, France,
> in which structural columns were not represented as a singular
> monolithic piece, but as many smaller linear elements. These linear
> elements would be drawn upward from the floor of the church to the top
> of the vaulted ceiling to create the experience of peer- ing into the
> heavens (Figure 5.34). This method is also used in games such as
> *Half-Life 2*, which utilizes vertical shadows on the Combine Citadel
> much in the same way shadows are used inside the structure: to create
> linear elements that draw the eye toward the shadows' vanishing point.

## SUMMARY

> We have begun our explorations of how to create emotionally evocative
> gamespaces by investigating spatial orientations related to primal
> survival instincts. We have seen that survival is core not only to our
> human experi- ence, but also to the experience of many video games,
> with the ability to continue playing being a very powerful reward
> indeed. We also explored the architecture of survival, which provided
> insights for creating paths through the use of prospects and refuges,
> for the use of lighting through shade and shadow, and for the use of
> height.
>
> While many of these architectures correspond with another primal
> emotion, fear, they can also be used to evoke other emotions by
> subvert- ing a player's vulnerability to the architectures themselves.
> Games such as Thatgamecompany's *Flower*48 has players breaking
> through shadowy envi- ronments, bringing light and color to a
> monochromatic world. *Batman: Arkham Asylum*49 turns the idea of
> prospect and refuge on its head by making the game's prospect spaces
> intimate to Batman's abilities, making him the lurking horror in it.
> Empowering players in this way can create exhilarating experiences,
> which we also explore in the next chapter as we discuss reward spaces.

> INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS PRUETT
>
> *Chief Taskmaster, Robot Invader*
>
> Chris Pruett is the founder and CEO of Robot Invader, developer of the
> mobile Android game *Wind-Up Knight*. He was previously Senior
> Developer Advocate at Google, responsible for bringing games to
> Android, and a senior programmer at Activision/Vicarious Visions. He
> is the author of Chris's Survival Horror Quest, an online blog in
> whichh he analyzes both famous and obscure horror games.
>
> *Can you name a game, level, or level designer (or multiples of each)
> whose work has left an impression on you? Why?*
>
> I am continually impressed with the design of the mansion in the
> original *Resident Evil*. Though the moment-to-moment gameplay
> involves shooting zombies, finding keys, and solving puzzles, the
> meta-game is about tracing routes through the maze-like mansion,
> finding shortcuts, and growing the size of the traversable space. Your
> job in the early *Resident Evil* games is to recursively unlock areas
> of the mansion until it becomes a complex, interconnected space, which
> you must then traverse as efficiently as possible to avoid excessive
> zombie encounters. In the end, it's the traversal of the (initially
> simple, eventually complex) map that requires the most brainpower; the
> zombies and puzzles are simply activities to complete on the way. This
> sort of design isn't unique to *Resident Evil*, but I think there are
> few games that do it better. It's very difficult to design this kind
> of space, but the *Resident Evil* games make it look easy.
>
> *Are there any media outside of gaming that you find inspire your
> work?*
>
> I am a big fan of Haruki Murakami's novels, particularly *The Wind-up
> Bird Chronicle*. I love the way the events in his writing take place
> deep below the surface of the narrative.
>
> I really enjoy film as well, though I watch a lot less than I used to.
> Occasionally I will discover a comic book that sends me reeling for a
> while. Most recently that award goes to two Japanese books,
> *Nijigahara Holograph* and *Sayuri*.
>
> *Describe your level design process---how do you begin? What tools do
> you use (on or off the computer)?*
>
> The process varies dramatically with the format of the game. For a
> plat- former like *Wind-Up Knight*, the level design cannot be started
> until the core mechanics are set in stone. So we do a lot of test
> levels with just boxes hanging in the air until we're able to lock
> down some of the core move set. From there we block out all of the
> levels using boxes and (often placeholder) enemies. Only when all of
> the levels are close to finished do we sit down and sort them into
> categories (generally by theme and difficulty), and only after that do
> we start to apply real art. Throughout this process we are constantly
>
> throwing things away and reworking ideas. *Wind-Up Knight* went
> through several months of iteration before we started generating
> levels that actually appeared in the final game.
>
> For our new, as-yet-unannounced project, the process is extremely
> differ- ent. This game is something a little more akin to the
> *Resident Evil* example I gave above: it's a space that is slowly
> opened over time for the player to explore. In this case, I started
> with a reasonable map layout (architectural plans for a house) and
> began by mapping the traversal of the player through it over the
> course of the game. From there I have applied a method called a puzzle
> dependency diagram which allows me to document the flow of puzzles
> through the space (puzzle C can't be completed before puzzles A and B
> are finished, etc.). So the design of the map and the contents of the
> rooms have been defined since very early in the project, and now our
> main job is to ensure that the pacing of progression matches the
> experience we intend to provide to the player.
>
> *What is your process for playtesting your levels?*
>
> We try to have as many people who are not on our team test as
> possible. It's useful to watch playtesters, but we also use automated
> analytics record- ing to identify issues. On *Replica Island*, I
> recorded the spots at which players died on a server, and then used
> that data to generate heat maps over the level geometry, which told me
> very quickly where the frustration points were.
>
> *Do you find art and atmospheric effects an important tool for
> communicating with players? Any specific examples?*
>
> This is also highly dependent on game style, but generally speaking,
> every tool at your disposal must be used to communicate with players.
> It's much harder than you might initially assume to send a player a
> message. Even giant flashing text on the screen will be missed (or
> ignored, or misunderstood) by some of your audience. So yes, we use
> art, sound, vibration, animation, UI--- everything we can to get
> messages through the glass.
>
> More specifically, Thomas Grip, the brains behind *Amnesia: The Dark
> Descent*, has a very useful idea about sense of presence. This is
> specifically applicable to atmospheric games. The idea is to remove
> all elements that might damage the feeling that the player is there in
> the world. This often causes heads-up display (HUD) elements to be
> entirely removed, but it doesn't stop there. Grip talks about removing
> unbelievable or out-of-place game elements whenever possible to
> maintain the sense of presence at all costs. For example, some
> developers like to leave jokes in the background art of their games
> (e.g., a movie poster named after the developer), but the sense of
> presence doctrine requires such elements to be removed.
>
> *How do you teach players to utilize your levels (without use of the
> GUI)?* There's nothing wrong with GUI, or more generally, non-worldly
> elements to ensure communication with the player. For example, *Metal
> Gear Solid* would be unplayable if it lacked the 2D question mark
> icons that appear above
>
> alerted enemies' heads. Better to ensure that the message is
> understood than to maintain some concept of realism.
>
> That said, a really good level designer guides the players through a
> space without them realizing that they are being guided. *Halo 1* does
> this very well, especially in outdoor environments. Subtle hills and
> efficient-looking valleys are used to guide the player exactly along
> the route that the designers want him to go without obvious breadcrumb
> items or GUI.
>
> For our current secret project, we attempt to force the player down a
> specific path by giving them things to do along that path. For
> example, if the player finds himself with a key in his inventory and
> one locked door, it is likely that he tries the door before exploring
> other areas. If there is something interesting beyond the door, we
> expect him to pass through the doorway and explore it. In this way we
> try to lead the player through the game without explicitly forcing
> them down a fixed path. We also allow for certain areas to be visited
> in any order before a choke point is reached (which is what the puzzle
> dependency diagram I mentioned above describes). *Gone Home* is a
> recent example of a game that does this very well.
>
> *How do you entice players to explore game levels (without use of the
> GUI)?* In a game like *Wind-Up Knight*, which is highly linear and
> exploration is not required to progress, we do it by dangling
> hard-to-reach items and secret passages in front of the player without
> telling them exactly where they are. For example, the player might see
> an alternate path, perhaps a subway below their feet, with items to
> collect. In order to find the entrance to that area, they'll have to
> go back and look for it, though players who are only interested in
> progression can skip it and move on.
>
> In our new project, exploration is the core element of the game, so we
> hope that players approach the experience with a willingness to
> explore already in their minds. That said, we use narrative (dropping
> clues for the player to think about while she solves other problems),
> key items (via the recursive unlocking scheme I mentioned above), and
> puzzles (which often require searching an area to complete) to promote
> and reward exploration.
>
> *If a player is lost in one of your levels, how can he find his way
> back to where he is supposed to be (without using the GUI)?*
>
> In *Wind-Up Knight*, this basically isn't possible. It's a platformer,
> it only moves in two dimensions, and the player's options are to
> progress or die.
>
> In our new game, we generally prevent players from getting lost by
> con- straining the size of the explorable space. Eventually they will
> unlock a larger space, but it's a collection of spaces they have
> explored before, with a few new spaces hanging off the edges. Though
> the space enlarges, players are already familiar with most of it. We
> try to ensure that there are only one or two new places to go at any
> time, so if a player is lost, he can simply find an area he is
> unfamiliar with and explore that. That direction is always a forward
> path.
>
> *How do you direct the actions of players in your levels? How do you
> encour- age players to play in undirected ways?*
>
> In our new game, we are using a technique common to many adventure
> games, which is to provide bits and pieces of problems and allow the
> player to resolve them out of order. For example, at any given time
> the player should have at most three outstanding problems to solve
> (where problems are things like a locked door, a combination lock, or
> the location of an item). These problems can be solved in any order,
> and once they are solved a new set of problems will be presented. More
> generally, each problem itself is solved by completing a series of
> steps, and if the player gets stuck on one step, he can go work on a
> different step for a different problem. The goal is to ensure that we
> almost never reach a point at which there is only one correct thing to
> do to progress. When those choke points do arrive, we try to make the
> next step as obvious as possible.
>
> This way the player solves problems at their own pace, in the order
> that they prefer, but stays within the progression structure that
> we've defined for them.
>
> *What laws of level design have you developed in your own work that
> any designer should know? What should they avoid?*
>
> For platformers: define metrics and use them. All of your jumps should
> be the same size, or from a small set of predefined sizes. The height
> of your platforms, the distance from a warning to an enemy, the
> minimum space between challenges, all of this should be rigorously
> defined and consistent from level to level. The player is trying to
> find patterns in your design, and it's your job to provide them.
>
> For adventure-style games: give the player no more than three problems
> to solve at any given time. Make areas that need to be investigated
> stand out from the background; the challenge should be to figure out
> what to do when you get there, not finding the exact pixel to click
> on. Be very wary of mixing "what do I do next?" challenges with "doing
> the next thing is mechanically hard" challenges. Give the player extra
> information if they try to investigate something more thoroughly.
> Close off paths that are no longer relevant to the game.
>
> For all games: checkpoints and save reloads must start the player
> facing the direction that they were facing when the game saved. Make
> the differ- ence between traversable and non-traversable areas
> exceedingly obvious.
>
> *You've done a considerable amount of game analysis for your blog,
> Chris's* Survival Horror Quest*. What spatial elements or types (room
> sizes, room types, architectural elements, etc.) have you seen
> through- out multiple games?*
>
> One common spatial theme in horror games is descent. Horror games
> almost always involve delving deeper and deeper underground. The
> general theme here is areas for which there is no clear escape route.
> This is often paired with one-way transitions (e.g., jumping into a
> hole). The message to the player is
>
> simple: you can't escape. You must press forward. It is a very
> oppressive message.
>
> *How do you utilize your study of other games to influence your own
> designs?* For some types of games, such as my current project, horror
> games provide a direct influence. I'm not making a horror game at the
> moment, but perhaps a close cousin to the genre, and things like the
> recursive unlocking setup are extremely valuable. But more generally,
> I think that thinking about games, and specifically why the designers
> made the decisions that they did, helps me think much more critically
> about my own games. Interestingly, I learn a lot more from the games
> that fail than from the games that succeed.
>
> *What place can environment art play in lending to an environment's
> mood? How can environment art allow designers to communicate with
> players?*
>
> I think this is a big piece of *Grip's* sense of presence theory. If
> the art distracts from the world, it will damage the sense of presence
> and hurt the over- all effectiveness of the game. If it pulls the
> player in, the opposite effect is achieved. *Silent Hill*, with its
> hellish Otherworld version of the regular level geometry, is king of
> this.
>
> *Once you've established how player characters move and react to
> player input, how do you best design game environments to address
> these capabilities?*
>
> Player input and mechanics come first. Once those are defined, we
> define the basic level metrics (pit sizes, platform heights, etc.).
> Once we have those things we can start to combine elements to make for
> complex strings of input. It's hard but very fun!
>
> *In* Wind-Up Knight, *the player had a considerable amount of moves he
> or she could utilize---jumping, fighting, shield use, and rolling. How
> did you teach players to utilize these actions appropriately in
> levels, and how did you reinforce them throughout the game?*
>
> We start the player off with just one action---jump---and then slowly
> add new moves over time. By level 9 they have the four basic inputs
> defined, but it's not until much later, sometime around level 16 or
> 17, that they actually have access to all of the Knight's moves. This
> is tricky---we want to ease the player into the game, but we also want
> to get to the complex move sets as quickly as possible, as that's
> where the really fun level designs come into play.
