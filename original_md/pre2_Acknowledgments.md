# Acknowledgments

> his book is the result of seven years of research and labor that grew
> out of my graduate school thesis on developing a game-based design
> method for architectural design. Through the development of this book
> I have had the support of a great many people who I will attempt to
>
> acknowledge here (sorry if I miss anyone).
>
> I thank the staff at AK Peters/CRC Press for allowing me to develop
> this project for publication, especially Rick Adams and David Fausel.
> I thank my wonderful reviewers, Jeff Howard (who also got me in touch
> with the publisher) and Helen Stuckey, whose direction was of great
> benefit to the quality of this book. Also thanks to my wonderful
> interviewees---Greg Grimsby, Chris Pruett, Robin Rath, Gnarwal
> Studios' Chris Weed and Joe Sklover and Eric Zimmerman---for offering
> their insight into their game and level design processes. Thanks also
> to the organizers of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) for
> sponsoring an event that allows game developers, writers, teachers,
> and students to meet and make valuable net- working connections, some
> of which made this book possible. Thanks to the GDC associate program
> for being such a wonderful part of my life and allowing me to get to
> GDC in the first place.
>
> I certainly would not have had the courage to pursue such a project
> were it not for the valuable opportunities to discuss the concepts in
> this book in several venues beforehand. For this I owe a great deal of
> gratitude to Christian Nutt at Gamasutra, who has helped me develop
> and publish several articles for that wonderful publication. I also
> thank the organizers of the East Coast Game Conference in Raleigh,
> North Carolina, and the Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) for
> allowing me to speak and properly "playtest" the information contained
> here.
>
> Many thanks to my supportive colleagues in the Computer Game Design
> Program at George Mason University: Mary Bean, Greg Grimsby, Seth
> Hudson, Scott Martin, Matt Nolan, Chris Ondrus, Boris Willis,

> Chris Wren, and Stewart VanBuren. Thanks to Dorothy Green for her help
> with this and other projects, and the members of the D.C. chapter of
> the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), especially Trey
> Reyher and Taro Omiya, who have been wonderful collaborators on many
> gaming endeavors. Thanks to the development team for my current proj-
> ect for their patience with me as I took time to write this. I
> certainly can- not forget the faculty of the Catholic University
> School of Architecture, who have supported my efforts since I began
> this journey.
>
> Lastly, I thank my parents, without whose guidance I would not have
> become the person to conceive of a project like this, and my amazing
> wife, Clara, whose encouragement and support have allowed me to make
> this book something tangible.
