# Introduction

> Game designer and theorist Ian Bogost has been quoted as saying that
> game design is a bit of a "black art."1 While many people outside the
> field underestimate the amount of work, expertise, and man- power
> required to make video games, many inside the industry are hum- bled
> by game design's staggering complexity. The International Game
> Developers Association (IGDA) 2008 curriculum framework for game
> design education is a testament to this complexity. Over twenty-seven
> pages of its forty-one-page length are devoted to a list of suggested
> topics to cover in an academic program on game design.2 In *The Art of
> Game Design: A Book of Lenses*,3 designer Jesse Schell highlights
> nineteen fields from which a successful game designer must draw
> knowledge. Both docu- ments cite topics including business and
> economics, programming, art, psychology, and theater performance
> theory. Clearly, the entirety of mod-
>
> ern game design is a daunting beast.
>
> Perhaps this is why an important part of the game design process,
> level design, is so often overlooked as a topic of serious study.
> Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams highlight level design's difficulty
> in their book *Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design* by
> arguing that there is no one standard way to design levels.4 Jay
> Wilbur and John Romero have great respect for the level designer's
> work, saying "Level Design is where the rubber hits the road"5 and
> "The level designer is largely responsible for the implementation of
> the game play in a title."6
>
> Level design is not only an important part of game development, it is
> also one of the most exhilarating. Many aspiring game designers get
> their start by creating their own custom levels, called mods, in
> toolsets for exist- ing games. This act of creating the environment
> for a game and then play- ing inside your creation is one of the most
> empowering parts of video games, as both a hobby and a profession.
> Some games, such as *The Sims*7
>
> **xxi**
>
> and *Little Big Planet*,8 even tout their level creation tools on
> their packaging to entice potential buyers.
>
> The importance of level design in a game project is exactly why it
> deserves careful consideration as a subject of both academic and
> profes- sional study. This book is such a study.

## WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?

> This is a book about level design. It is also about how to look at
> designed space, which game levels, environments, and worlds most
> certainly are. Real-world architecture, urban environments, and
> gardens are also designed spaces. At some point, a designer (it
> doesn't matter which kind; design is mostly universal) sat down to
> solve a problem that could only be solved by designing an interactive
> space. This problem could be how to best capture sunlight coming
> through a window, embody a religious idea, accentuate an important
> clue to solving a puzzle, or provide the best posi- tion for fragging
> competitors in an online game. Sometimes these spaces are loved by the
> people who use them, whether it is a home to raise a fam- ily, a plaza
> to enjoy a latte and some people watching, or a city in which to shoot
> gangsters and jump cars off of piers.
>
> Comparing level design and architecture can be very simple. It can
> also allow us to reveal things about both we have not seen before.
> This book reflects on both based on how they solve problems and create
> meaning- ful experiences for those using them. From these reflections,
> this book provides an architectural approach to level design that
> emphasizes spatial design for maximum user engagement.

## WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM ARCHITECTURE?

> In recent years, the topic of game and level design investigating the
> field of architecture has appeared in many industry discussions,
> articles, and conference talks. When people think of integrating
> architectural thought with game design, they often turn to
> environmental art styles or refer- ences to famous buildings. While
> these things help create interesting level experiences, they are also
> the tip of the iceberg in terms of game design's current relationship
> with architectural design. Rather than simply turn- ing to
> architecture as a reference for surface level visual elements, we can
> study how architects conduct space and occupant movement. We can also
> look to architecture and the many fields it references for
> inspiration, to understand spatial planning, organization, and how to
> manage relation- ships between a space and its occupants.
>
> Many seminal books on game design and many seminal game designers do
> not base their methodologies for creating experiences in game design
> alone. To do so is very difficult and risks limiting the body of
> knowledge we can learn from. While games have arguably existed as long
> as modern man, video games have only existed for about forty years.
> While the current video game design texts have done well build- ing a
> critical discourse in that amount of time, there is still much work to
> be done.
>
> The books and designers that do, however, pull from other fields often
> do so to fill in blanks that game design itself cannot fill. How do
> you create a meaningful succession of rewards to entice players
> through your game and teach them how to play? Look no further than
> B.F. Skinner's theory of operant behavior.9 Need a narrative structure
> for your hero's epic quest? Try Joseph Campbell's monomyth of the
> hero's journey.10 What about a way to make little computer people
> happy in their little computer environ- ment? Try Christopher
> Alexander's *A Pattern Language*.11
>
> This book will do the same for level design, taking architectural
> prin- ciples and using them as inspiration for video game levels and
> environ- ments. Like the above examples, level design does not need to
> stand on its own, but can pull from thousands of years of human
> knowledge that came before it was a professional field. As designed
> space, game levels have much to learn from their precursors in
> real-life architecture, including the development of sight lines,
> lighting conditions, shade and shadow, explo- ration, orientation,
> spatial rhythms, and even how to get epic spaces to be even more
> epic---among other things.

## BUILDING A BRIDGE BETWEEN GAMES AND ARCHITECTURE

> All of this discussion of level design and architecture is well and
> good, but it is ultimately meaningless unless the spaces that result
> fit into the context of a game. A game, as defined by Katie Salen and
> Eric Zimmerman, is "a system in which players engage in an artificial
> conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome."12
>
> To design a game, therefore, is to create the system, the rules by
> which it runs and by which a player interacts with it, the artificial
> conflict it is meant to embody, and the criteria by which an outcome
> is reached in the system. This closely reflects Salen and Zimmerman's
> definition of *design*: "the process by which a designer creates a
> context to be encountered by a participant, from which meaning
> emerges."13
>
> This definition can mean the design of either games or architecture.
> In architecture, the architect is the designer, the building or urban
> space is the context, the participant is anyone who occupies our
> space, and the expe- riences that the occupant has while in the space
> are the meaning that emerges from it. However, establishing a parallel
> is not enough; a true link must be established between the design of
> games and the design of architecture.
>
> Consider Rudolf Kremers's definition of level design: "This is a basic
> purpose of level design, to interpret the game rules, and to translate
> them into a construct (a level) that best facilitates play. Another
> way of express- ing this is by stating that 'level design is applied
> game design.'"14
>
> Kremers's definition is a good one that addresses a level's function
> as a facilitator of a game's rules, as expressed by Wilbur and Romero,
> and as a construct created by a designer. Where Kremers's definition
> falters, however, is in the expression of the level as a medium for
> creating game- play *and* for using spatial design principles to
> facilitate meaningful user experiences. These experiences can be
> created through cognitive interac- tions with the player or through
> emotional means---all executed through spatial methods that will be
> discussed in later chapters. A better definition for the purposes of
> this book would be: "level design is the thoughtful execution of
> game*play* into game*space* for players to dwell in."
>
> The best level designers do not only take the contents of a game's
> ruleset and embody them in an interactive space. They also
> thoughtfully employ spatial articulations that enhance a player's
> journey through that space. These articulations give previews of
> what's to come, allow players to orient themselves in the environment,
> provide narrative clues without the need for overt storytelling
> methods such as cutscenes, and entice further exploration. Such spaces
> are gamespaces---spaces that both embody gameplay and facilitate the
> player's journey through it, allowing him or her to better experience
> the game's mechanics. These spaces do so in such a way that players
> spend more time having fun and less time figuring out how to use the
> space. As a field that has perfected these kinds of spatial
> experiences over thousands of years, architecture is the perfect
> precedent to teach us
>
> how to create better gamespaces.

## WHAT THIS BOOK WILL TEACH YOU

> This book explores architectural techniques and theories for level
> design- ers to use in their own work. The utilized approach connects
> architecture and level design in different ways that address the
> practical elements of how designers construct space and the
> experiential elements of how and
>
> why humans interact with this space. Throughout the book, you will
> learn the skills listed below.
>
> Spatial Layout
>
> Learning how to create a spatial sequence is paramount to the study of
> architectural design. Over centuries of work, the field of
> architecture has developed a methodology for going from design idea to
> constructed building. These methods include sketching and modeling
> crude forms to generate a building idea. They also include more
> sophisticated render- ings of buildings through plan, section,
> elevation, perspective, and even modern 3D visualization techniques.
> While this book avoids exploring the nuances of drafting, these
> techniques will be used to illustrate how to get both macro and micro
> views of your gamespaces for the sake of event layout and pacing.
>
> Beyond the types of media used to plan buildings, the book also
> explores how architects deal with materials not just from a structural
> standpoint, but also from an aesthetic one. While level designers deal
> with materials primarily on a visual level, the practical concerns of
> material use can be very useful for level designers. For example, many
> newer level designers wonder how to make the box-shaped spaces
> inherent to many level editors seem less boxy. They also wonder how to
> make their realistically textured surfaces feel more like real-world
> materials they are conveying in the eyes of players. Understanding how
> architects use these materials will help cre- ate better gamespaces.
>
> Evoking Emotion through Gamespaces
>
> If using spatial layout techniques is how we create contexts for users
> to inhabit, then the emotions these contexts create are what give
> these con- texts life. Many buildings in the architectural canon are
> there because they evoke some greater idea or emotion from occupants.
> The same can be said of great game levels. Using the arrangements of
> space as a jump- ing off point, this book will explore how these
> arrangements respond to emotional factors of game players.
>
> One way in which game designers and architects are inherently differ-
> ent is in the functions of their spaces. While architects typically
> design for pure function or for the embodiment of positive emotions,
> game design- ers are free to utilize negative emotions such as anger,
> aggression, or fear. Architects have developed a set of rules not only
> for what to do in design, but also what not to do. Game designers can
> look to both sets of rules for
>
> inspiration, arranging the "what to do" spaces among the "what not to
> do" spaces to create an emotionally exhilarating sequence of gameplay.
>
> Creating Better Levels through Architectural Theory
>
> Rollings and Adams are correct in saying that there is no one way to
> design levels. For example, a common level design technique such as
> *white- blocking*, which will be explored in Chapter 2, can mean
> different things to different designers. On the other hand, there are
> common truths to spatial arrangement that transcend concerns about
> software techniques. By studying spatial arrangement techniques
> utilized in great architecture and the kinds of experiences these
> create, level designers will be able to create similar experiences in
> their own work regardless of the tools they are using.
>
> The effect that level design has on games is profound. As Kremers
> points out, "Bad level design can ruin a good game."15 In current
> level design practice, playtesting---evaluating a level by having
> people play it many times to test for experiential and technical
> functionality---is the standard way of ensuring that levels are good.
> Utilizing architectural principles of spatial design in addition to
> playtesting can do two things to make this process easier. The first
> is allowing designers to utilize historically success- ful spatial
> sequences at the outset of design rather than having them only reach
> success through experimentation or by copying previous games. Second,
> having a knowledge of architectural design can give level design- ers
> a broader vocabulary with which to create gamespaces. As is common in
> many branches of design, level designers may be aware of many success-
> ful spatial layouts through their experiences in the field or through
> play- ing games. However, gaining a vocabulary for these layouts
> transforms them from vaguely understood secrets to concrete tools that
> can be used over and over again to great effect.

## WHAT THIS BOOK WILL NOT TEACH YOU

> While this book attempts to offer a broad exploration of design
> concepts that can enrich level design, there is also a lot of
> information that is outside of its scope. Some of these topics are
> addressed here to quell any confusion over the material in this book.
>
> Environment Art
>
> Many game designers confuse level design with the field of environment
> art. While both contribute to one final finished game level, we will
> treat
>
> these as two distinct disciplines for the purposes of this book. Level
> design is concerned with the sequence of spaces in a game level and
> how they cre- ate a better gameplay experience for users. Environment
> art, on the other hand, is the creation of art assets (3D models, 2D
> sprites, tiles, or textures) that create the look of a game
> environment. Neither is more or less impor- tant than the other, as
> good environment art will enliven the sequence of spaces that a level
> designer creates and often give it a context within the game's
> narrative. Likewise, a good level can utilize environment art assets
> as part of its system of visual communication---communicating to the
> player through the repetition of specific assets that come to mean
> things within the context of a game.
>
> While this book explores how to best use environment art to commu-
> nicate to players, it does not cover how to create 3D models or 2D
> textures, sprites, or tiles in art asset creation programs such as 3D
> Studio Max, Maya, Blender, or Photoshop. There are, however, many
> other great books on these topics, which you should explore if you are
> interested in creating environment art in these programs.
>
> CAD Software
>
> This book will also not teach you how to utilize computer-aided design
> (CAD) or building information modeling (BIM) software. As with art
> asset creation software, teaching these software packages is outside
> the scope of the book.
>
> As for the use of this software to level designers, CAD is discussed
> in Chapter 2, "Tools and Techniques for Level Design," as a potential
> tool for level design, though for different reasons than how
> architects use it. BIM, on the other hand, is of little use to level
> designers, as it is much more tightly connected to the construction
> management functions of real-world architecture. BIM programs such as
> Revit or ArchiCAD allow designers to create drawings of buildings
> using premade elements---doors, windows, structural elements,
> etc.---and store construction information in each specific element
> that can be used for ordering materials and direct- ing contractors.
>
> Game Engines
>
> In most applications, level design occurs within programs known as
> game engines, that are used to create video games. Modern game engines
> provide a framework for rendering assets on screen, responding to
> player input, facilitating artificial intelligence (AI) interactions,
> simulating real-world
>
> physics, among other things. In the industry, many different game
> engines exist, with some studios building their own for internal use.
> While there are popular ones, there is no universally agreed-upon
> industry standard as with other types of software.
>
> This book describes a selection of engines that are popular at the
> time of its writing, but it avoids providing in-depth software
> tutorials for using these engines. This is done for two reasons: one
> is the aforementioned lack of an industry standard. If this book
> contained tutorials in the Unity engine, for example, it would be a
> Unity engine book, rather than one approach- able for users of Source
> or the Unreal Development Kit. Engines come and go as technology
> advances, so it is hoped that readers can get more ever- green
> knowledge from this book even when today's engines are historic
> footnotes. As with environment art, a wide selection of books that
> teach the use of these game engines is available that interested
> readers can explore.

## WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK

> This book looks at level design through the lens of architectural and
> spatial experience theory. While matters relevant to game art are
> discussed, it is not a book on environmental modeling or how to create
> 3D game assets. If you have not yet bought this book and are perhaps
> reading it in a book- store, then you may want to see if you fit into
> one of the following groups:
>
> *The level designer who wants to understand architecture better and
> bring elements of it into his or her work.* Many discussions of game
> levels and architecture focus on environment art creation, with
> statements of how "cool" certain architectural styles or layouts would
> look in the art for a game. This book brings level designers into the
> fray by dis- cussing spatial concepts that have bearing on the layout
> and arrange- ment of gamespaces relevant to their gameplay goals. It
> also features interviews with industry veterans who have spent time
> building game levels and worlds, or who have contributed to the field
> in other ways.
>
> *The environment artist seeking to better communicate with players
> through his or her work.* The environment artist is not forgotten in
> this text. Visual communication with players involves the graphics,
> colors, forms, and textures that constitute a game's environmen- tal
> art assets. Throughout the book, methodologies for utilizing a game's
> artistic presentation together with its spatial gameplay design are
> proposed for creating memorable player experiences.
>
> *Teachers and students studying level design.* This book approaches
> level design from a point of view that synthesizes several bodies of
> knowl- edge into one source and employs them through case studies.
> With the advent of the game design degree, a danger facing the
> industry is the loss of the eclectic experiences of designers who come
> from other back- grounds to join the gaming industry. By viewing an
> important element of game creation, level design, through topics
> relevant to architecture, this book gives teachers and students in
> game design programs a broad landscape to pull from. Students
> especially can look to designer inter- views to gain insight into the
> process from industry veterans.
>
> *Architects.* While this book mainly focuses on the practice of level
> design as educated by architectural principles, it is also written to
> enliven architectural design through the implementation of game design
> methodologies. This book recommends an iterative workflow focused
> around playtesting and audience interaction in interactive spatial
> simulations. Many architects today find themselves frustrated by the
> confines of 2D space and the guesswork that comes with trying to cre-
> ate meaningful spatial experiences with plan, elevation, and section
> drawings. This book discusses space and architecture as an interactive
> medium dependent on user input, much as it was throughout history.
>
> Overall, if you have an interest in game design, level design, or
> archi- tecture, this book will provide a focused and practical
> approach to level design that cannot be found elsewhere. Whether you
> are a professional level designer, artist, or teacher looking for
> another perspective on your craft, a game design student looking for
> input from other industries, or an architect trying to learn what all
> these interactive technologies can do for your own industry, this book
> has something for you. As games approach that murky and
> difficult-to-define status known as art, they should be studied in the
> light of other fields that create meaningful user experiences or even
> as brave new examples for the established canon.

## HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

> This book is separated into a variety of topics on experiential
> concepts in architectural and video game level design. These concepts
> are approached in a general manner rather than focusing on specific
> game types or genres. For example, there are no chapters with names
> such as "Sight Lines for First-Person Shooters," but rather ones on
> spatial design elements that can be applied to many game types. This
> was done purposefully so that
>
> the techniques are explored in a less prescriptive manner, and so that
> designers can implement them in any way they choose.
>
> While the subject of each chapter can be understood without read- ing
> the chapters that came before, each portion of the book builds on the
> knowledge from previous sections. As such, it is recommended that
> readers read chapters in order to avoid confusion when a chapter
> refers to information given in one preceding it.

## HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

> This book practices some software agnosticism by not making tutorials
> in a certain application a requirement. However, readers may wish to
> practice the level design methods in one of several popular game
> engines. Many of the most widely used game engines for both
> independent and commercial game development offer free versions, often
> for non-commercial use. Check their websites to find out the exact
> terms of how they may be licensed. Here are a few links to websites

## WHAT'S INSIDE THIS BOOK

> This book explores an architectural approach to level design through a
> variety of topics on spatial design. Each topic is accompanied by
> stud- ies of both game level and real worldbuilding cases. Through
> these stud- ies, the book proposes spatial design principles for game
> levels in 2D, 3D, and multiplayer applications. Each chapter is also
> accompanied by a level design exercise so users can practice what
> they've learned. The chapters and the topics they cover are as
> follows.
>
> *Chapter 1, "A Brief History of Architecture and Level Design"*
>
> This chapter gives a brief overview of the architectural history that
> is rel- evant throughout the rest of the book. This includes a listing
> of styles and techniques from prehistory through Postmodernism. This
> chapter also discusses several milestones in how the spaces of games
> evolved from single-screen games with limited movement into the
> sprawling 3D worlds of current games.
>
> *Chapter 2, "Tools and Techniques for Level Design"*
>
> This chapter further explores our definition of level design and
> provides an overview of some useful tools for level designers to use
> in creating their gamespaces, including popular software packages such
> as Unity, the Unreal Development Kit, and the Source engine. It also
> details types of architectural drawings and visualization useful for
> planning spaces. Lastly, it covers some game design workflows, how
> they can utilize architectural techniques, and how they can be used to
> implement spatial designs.
>
> *Chapter 3, "Basic Gamespaces"*
>
> This chapter teaches lessons on architectural spatial arrangement,
> start- ing from basic principles and then applying these principles to
> several
>
> famous types of gamespaces, such as linear and sandbox spaces. It then
> analyzes spaces in famous games to discover spatial types that can be
> used among a variety of games. Lastly, it discusses how game cameras
> accen- tuate level spaces in games based on their positioning in
> relation to the player character.
>
> *Chapter 4, "Teaching in Levels through Visual Communication"*
>
> Chapter 4 moves beyond overviews of how spaces are used in games and
> investigates how creating repeatable architectural forms allows
> designers to communicate with players. Such techniques are
> demonstrated as meth- ods for changing player behaviors and teaching
> players game mechanics through subtle in-level tutorials. They are
> also discussed as methods for helping players retain and develop their
> knowledge of how to play through a game through level design.
>
> *Chapter 5, "Introducing Emotional Level Design through Survival
> Instincts"*
>
> This chapter introduces spatial arrangements and techniques that allow
> designers to evoke emotions connected with human survival instincts.
> It shows how arrangements of specifically sized spaces entice players
> to move along paths. It also shows techniques for using lighting to
> engage curiosity or fear responses.
>
> *Chapter 6, "Enticing Players with Rewarding Spaces"*
>
> Chapter 6 utilizes psychological theories popular with game designers
> to discover how game levels can reward players. It explores the
> architectural principle of denial to show how spaces and sight lines
> can be used to make levels that entice players to move through them.
>
> *Chapter 7, "Storytelling in Gamespace"*
>
> This chapter addresses narrative elements of games and explores the
> dif- ferent ways that built spaces can tell or facilitate stories. It
> discusses how changes in materials and environment art can assist the
> storytelling pro- cess. It also explores how storytelling
> opportunities can be rewards for passing through difficult gameplay
> sequences.
>
> *Chapter 8, "Possibility Spaces and Worldbuilding"*
>
> This chapter discusses how game levels can be built to accommodate
> differ- ent player styles and create robust worlds with many play
> choices. It discusses
>
> how some gamespaces expand based on the abilities players have and
> that they acquire during gameplay. It also shows how some architects
> and game designers provide visual overviews of the spaces they create,
> and how ancient practices of Japanese garden design can inform the
> designs of game worlds.
>
> *Chapter 9, "Influencing Social Interaction with Level Design"*
>
> Chapter 9 explores how urban designers arrange buildings of different
> use types to facilitate social interaction and unforeseen in-game
> events. These studies can influence quest structure in single-player
> games, or even how players interact in massively multiplayer online
> (MMO) games.
>
> *Chapter 10, "Enhancing Level Design with Music and Sounds"*
>
> Chapter 10 addresses an often-overlooked part of spatial design in
> games: sound design. It explores how architects have used acoustic
> design to cre- ate different spatial experiences and how rhythms in
> space and sound can drive gameplay. It also explores how sound can
> enhance many of the spa- tial types found elsewhere in the book.
>
> *Chapter 11, "Real-World Adaptive Level Design"*
>
> In this final chapter, level design is taken out of video games and
> brought in to the real world through modern trends in outdoor game
> design. This chapter discusses how to utilize level design principles
> to design games for existing urban and outdoor spaces. Through these
> types of games, designers can allow people to discover new things
> about their own real-world environments.
